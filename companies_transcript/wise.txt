this is Zach fuss an investor at ironic
capital and today we're breaking down
wise wise helps individuals and small
businesses move money across borders it
offers significantly faster and cheaper
International transfers than traditional
banking routes because of its innovative
closed loop system
12 years after its founding why serves 6
million customers and earn close to a
billion pounds in income last year
investors currently value the business
which is listed in London at 6 billion
pounds to break down wise I'm joined by
former payments exec and now investor at
sydney-based TDM growth Partners James
Revell we cover the broken system of
correspondent banking which has led to
slow opaque and expensive transfers and
then explore how wise is counter
positioned itself to take advantage of
this large Market please enjoy our
breakdown of Lies
James thank you so much for joining us
to break down wise I thought a good
place to kick things off was just to
very simply present to us what is wise
and what is the key product or core
competency of the business so it's cool
wise is a cross-border money transfer
business it was founded in 2011 by two
estonians it was founded actually as
transferwise which goes to the point
that there are money transfer business
when we're talking about money transfer
it's probably worth breaking that down
into what wise is and what wise isn't so
it is more focused on retail payment so
smaller peer-to-peer or small businesses
transferring money across borders so
between two different jurisdictions it's
a digital focused business which is an
important thing which we can come back
to later when we're talking about
margins that means it doesn't really
handle cash which on the other side of
the fence in the cross-border money
transfer market you have companies like
Western Union and MoneyGram which many
people might have heard of which are
more remittance businesses and when we
talk about remittance we're talking
about normally companies servicing
migrants so economic migrants working
overseas needing to transfer money back
to families in their home country we're
also not talking with wise about
e-commerce so sometimes when we talk
about cross-border payments people might
be thinking about card payments on
foreign websites we're not talking about
that in this case with wires we're
talking about normally bank account
transfers and interestingly when we talk
about bank accounts why is funnily
enough isn't a bank so it is a licensed
financial institution but it's not a
bank I guess to zoom out a bit and talk
more broadly about how this business
came to be has a pretty interesting
founding story and I think it helps to
better appreciate what the product is if
you haven't used it so maybe let's just
talk a bit about how we got from the
founding story to where we are today
so we'll go back to
2007-2008 you've got the two Founders
they're two estonians so one's called
Christo Carmen and the other one's
called Target Henriques two estonians
actually living and working in London
they both have bank accounts in Estonia
but they've also set up bank accounts in
the UK and that's important we'll come
back to that so living and working in
London however
Bristow is working as a consultant for
Deloitte in London and he's being paid
in pounds in the UK on the other hand
tarvert is working for Skype funnily
enough he was skype's first employee
he's still being paid in Euros back in
Estonia this is where their stories
differ so Kruger still wants to move
money back to Estonia to take advantage
of some of the higher interest rates
that were back in Estonia back in
2007-2008 so being paid in pounds in
London but having to transfer money back
to Estonia every month on the other hand
tavets being paid in Estonia and euros
and he was obviously incurring expenses
in London so needing to transfer money
from Estonia to London so every month
they would both queue up at the banks
they would wait in line so it's Christo
once it depends for a thousand pounds
from the UK to Estonia the bank says
sure fill out this paperwork we'll
charge you 25 pounds to transfer this
thousand pounds and Crystal is like sure
what choice do I have five days later
takes a lot of time for this money to
transfer he checks his bank statement is
expecting something like 1200 Euros to
land in his Estonian account what
actually happens every month is 1100
Euros lands or
1140 Euros lands and Christo actually
tells the story where he thought he'd
been scammed or summoned fat fingered
made mistakes so he inquired about it
and what he realized was and what a lot
of people don't realize is there are a
lot of hidden fees in that exchange so
what the banks do they'll quote you a
fee up front and then they'll charge a
market up on the foreign exchange and
that's something that Christo didn't
know Harvard's experiencing this but
just in Reverse so he's trying to
transfer Euros to the UK also having
similar problems inconvenient opaque no
idea when the money's going to turn up
and he's being charged hidden fees they
actually met at a party both were having
a good odd whinge about this and they
realized they could solve each other's
problems so what they decided to do was
they actually sparked up a Skype chat
and every month they would go into
Reuters or Google or whatever get your
foreign exchange rate from and they
would agree I will Christo transfer tar
that you my pounds in the UK and tell
that you transfer me your Euros in
Estonia the end of fact is they've made
a cross-border transfer they've got what
they wanted the currency exchange but no
money has crossed a border so they get
the money pretty much straight away it's
completely transparent and they're not
being charged any hidden fees so they
basically solved this problem of
cross-border transfers and they've kind
of bypassed it you might see it as a bit
of a loophole or a bit of an Arbitrage
of the existing system but they realize
people just really care about the
outcome they don't really care about how
that money actually moves so they
thought there might be a big Market here
they started a Skype chat and they
expanded it to friends and friends of
friends before they knew it they're
essentially running an order book with
pounds on one side of The Ledger and
Euros on the other and they would match
me so they would try and connect this
what does essentially a peer-to-peer
market for cross-border and inverted
commas money transfer and that Zack is
exactly how wise works today but on a
massive scale the only difference being
rather than having to connect Crystal
and tar there or strangers with
strangers wise has a series of domestic
accounts that you can transfer money to
so in the instance we've just discussed
Christo would transfer his pounds to the
wise UK account wise would then
communicate internally with their
Estonian account why is the Sony account
with disperse Heroes to Target or
Crystal is it standing account whoever
and then exactly the same would happen
in reverse that solves the coordination
problem but again there is no money
actually Crossing Borders it's all
staying within that one single platform
and we'll get on to it later but that
solves a lot of the problems that they
saw up front when they were going
through the traditional banking rails
the other beauty of this system is
Target and Christo you know are mystical
creatures here they're both being
charged for a cross-border money
transfer but in reality wise is only
incurring domestic costs so that is
essentially The Leverage that this
business has and why structurally
they're set up so differently to what
exists to that
that was a really rich background of how
they kind of went from what was an
abstract and complicated means of
matching friends and acquaintances in
regards to the ability to exchange
currency to a somewhat large business
today so can you help us to understand
the size and scale of what they're doing
from that standing start and what was it
2011 founded in 2011 by 2014 they'd done
a billion pounds in cross-border
transfers which is enormous today
they're on track to do around a hundred
billion pounds in transfer volume in the
year and that's still growing North at
40 percent
that has translated through on track to
do probably just shy this year of a
billion pounds in total income they've
got 60 gross profit margin so 600
million pounds in gross profit and
that's flowing through it's about 200
million pounds in ebitda so about a 20
emitter margin which we can come back to
which is kind of a fascinating story so
it's a very large business it's listed
enlisted in 2021 on the London Stock
Exchange via direct listing and its
current market cap is about six billion
pounds outside of just financials it's
got about six million customers and
that's broken down between five and a
half million personal customers at about
320 000 businesses and they're normally
the smaller End Town businesses they
don't play in that Enterprise space
they're active in about 80 countries
about 50 currencies which results in
about two and a half thousand currency
routes now this whole machine is powered
by about 5 000 employees across 28
offices around the world I think we
should go into a bit about what
differentiates them and what are their
true competitive advantages because I
think it helps to better inform however
time they're going to accomplish their
goal and what that potentially means for
the rest of the players in the space and
where their profit pools and margins may
go as a function of it maybe I'll start
with just providing a bit more context
and background on the cross-border money
transfer market and that can set up this
counter position whites has so if you
think about cross-border money transfers
it goes back thousands of years there
are history books written on this but
ultimately back in the day it would have
been gold bullion or precious methyl
spices being loaded onto ships and
transferred across borders obviously
that was quite impractical comes from
security concerns and costs and all
sorts over time we're talking 11th 12th
century now the bill of exchange was
created whereby you could essentially
create an IOU which meant you didn't
need to transfer actual money or
currency across borders there's more a
paper-based exchange of value that could
be redeemed at a bank these were posted
at the time and then that has grown into
Telex messaging when cross-atlantic
cables are laid and this electronic
means of communication between banks
around five and so the history of
cross-border transfers if you think
about it money stopped moving across
borders a long time ago it was a lot of
credits and debits of accounts with each
Banks held with each other moving
numbers around on ledgers as opposed to
money actually being sent on a ship or
through this kind of pipe it's just a
series of relationships between Banks
that's known as correspondent Banking
and we can come back to some of the
problems with that model but maybe just
set up then how big this Market is so
they think there's about 100 trillion
pounds of volume transferred across
borders every year if you cut out say
the really big Enterprise government or
interbank transfers you're left with
about two trillion pounds of personal
cross-border transfers and about nine
trillion pounds of small business is
transferring money across borders so
this is a colossal market and that flows
through to say a revenue line of
anywhere between 100 and 200 billion
pounds paid in fees by customers in
terms of the split of that market about
two-thirds still sits with banks about
10 to 20 percent with money transfer
operators like the Western Unions and
the money grams and the rest is split up
between the remaining players the
Market's growing so on average growing
about five percent per annum over the
past decade but interestingly fees are
reducing there's some pressure on fee
down was largely caused by wires but
also by regulatory attention but 2008
2009 it was about nine percent in fees
it's now like I said close to six seven
percent the Tailwinds behind this
Market's largely been driven by
globalization so international trade and
Supply chains Global e-commerce
International traveler migration and
it's received like I said a lot of
regulatory attention so the G20 and the
FSB are really focused on this right now
the UN have set a goal but by 2030
cross-border transfer fee should be
close to three percent and why that is
is because it's a very inefficient way
of doing things fees are very high and
largely unfortunately the people that
suffer uh normally immigrants trying to
work overseas and transfer money every
month back home to support their
families and so that's one reason I
think the regulatory attention has come
the other reason is because Financial
crime and the proceeds of crime
transferring across borders if that's in
cash that causes a problem so
underpinning this Market is what's known
as correspondent banking which is the
relationship between banks around the
world so if you're say Commonwealth Bank
Australia you need to transfer money to
Barclays in the UK you may not have a
direct relationship or say you're a
credit union in Australia will be very
unlikely to have a relationship with a
bank in the UK and so you'll come
attacked a bank in Australia who will
contact a bank in say the UK who will
then contact the recipients Bank this
chain of communication between Banks is
called correspondent Banking and what
they're doing is
basically transferring the request and
the amount of money they need to send as
well as the customer information now the
way the banks do this communication is
Reliant upon an organization called
Swift so Swift is owned by 200 Banks
it's used by over 11 000 of them and it
stands for the Society of worldwide
interbank Financial telecommunication so
it's essentially an electronic
communication Network that tries to put
in place a Common Language and some
standards around how cross-border
transfers work what format data needs to
come in so you may have heard of a Swift
Code or an iband number these are
identifiers that Banks use globally to
help them manage this complex network of
communication which underpins these
transfers that doesn't take away the
individual effort put onto banks in
order to complete transfers and so maybe
just to run through the process quickly
first of all you've got to find a link
say you want to transfer money to
Thailand as a bank you may need to go
through three or four different banks to
get to the recipients bank and so you've
got to find a way of getting to the
recipient Bank
every step of the way you need to
validate the data you needed to complete
the regulatory checks
you then need to potentially transform
the data and for the next Bank along in
the chain you need to transmit it you
then need to sort out funding on the
back end so settling crediting and
debiting accounts this could be like a
50 transfer and these six Banks all need
to communicate they all need to settle
funds and they all need to reconcile and
make sure that all checks were completed
all data has been transferred accurately
and everyone's got the money they need
that setup you can see that there's a
ton of problems caused by that the first
and the most obvious one which has been
growing over the past 10 years
particularly since the GFC the
Regulatory and compliance burden along
that chain is huge so making sure that
there's no anti-money laundering going
on there's no counter-terrorism
financing going on you've got your
sanctions checks you've got to protect
data so you've got to be mindful of
privacy you've got Prudential worries
about liquidity and Bank regulations
when consumer protections like if
something goes wrong you've got to solve
disputes so there's an enormous amount
of complexity just on the regulation and
compliance side there are interesting
things like opening hours so Banks
communicating across the world they have
different opening hours the way Banks
transfer money domestically between each
other is normally done in a batch
process model whereby it's only up
operating five days a week and it's
certain times of that day so if you span
a weekend if your money's not moving
there's also a lot of paper and Legacy
technology involved there's liquidity
and foreign exchange risks so if
transfers between Banks aren't done
simultaneously which often they aren't
that creates liabilities between Banks
which is problems in Banks charge fees
for that so correspondent banking has a
lot of inefficiency built in and that
flows through so those supply side
problems flow through the problems for
customers like our Paul Christo and
tarvert back in 2008 it's incredibly
expensive every handoff along the chain
they need to be paid it's slow each step
along the chain obviously there's some
waiting time involved and it's opaque
often up front when a transfer starts
you have no idea how much it's going to
cost when it comes out the other end
and ultimately it's inconvenient so I
think where we should take this
conversation is further exploring that
closed loop system that you've referred
to because I think if my interpretation
of the business is correct that really
is where the massive value unlock comes
from to the extent that they're
successful in making that the core
strategy of the business I want to help
to better understand why even though
it's called cross-border in many ways
it's not like the mechanic is such that
things can stay where they are but they
can charge the fees that are associated
with it and not only save their
customers money but also realize a very
healthy margin you'll spot on Zach the
wise business model is based on them
maintaining this Global Network of bank
accounts that they own so their wise as
bank accounts and then they manage so
what correspondent banking involves and
the problem all kind of stems from the
need to communicate out outside of your
company so you need to engage a
different company you need to
communicate with them that's often
across borders in a different data
format it's in a different language
different time zone so communicating
outside of your own company causes the
problems and what wise does it keeps
that communication and keeps ownership
of all those bank accounts within its
own network and so if it needs to
transfer money to Japan from the UK it
has a Japanese bank account it has a UK
bank account and then they've built this
technology infrastructure that manages
that communication flow and the
liquidity between accounts but basically
they're just moving money around on
their own internal Legacy and you as a
customer experience the money being
transferred across border ball wise is
doing is collecting your money in the UK
and dispersing money from its own
account in Japan to your recipient's
bank it's a loophole in the system it's
Arbitrage of a broken system that
they've managed to fill it seems like a
pretty basic value proposition and I'm
trying to better understand what else
are they doing what is the Special Sauce
behind this business and then what are
the products and services that they can
kind of wrap around that key competency
in the way that you see a lot of
businesses that do something that
correct me if I'm wrong does seem
somewhat commoditized and then create
value in a way such that they can
capture such robust margins I think this
is the Crux of the business it's a
fascinating counter position they have
to the status quo the value proposition
is hammered home by this business every
single day to their customers into the
market so the first value proposition is
price there are about 10 times cheaper
than the average cross-border money
transfer fee if you look at the World
Bank it's about six and a half percent
fee to transfer your money overseas the
wise average customer price at the
moment is about 65 basis points so 10
times cheaper the second pillar of their
value proposition customers is speed
about 50 percent of all of that
cross-border transfer volume arrives
instantly at about 90 is done within 24
hours which is phenomenal I mean if you
go back four years zero percent was
instant so that commitment to speed is
something that if you're going through a
bank you're waiting up to five days
particularly if you're a business that
lack of certainty is a big problem the
third is transparency
so going back to the founding story
Christo had no idea that there was that
hidden fee and that markup being applied
to the Foreign Exchange in fact Studies
have shown only about four percent of
customers know the true cost of
transferring money overseas so wise is
extremely transparent about the fees
it's going to charge it tries to be
extremely transparent about how long
it's going to take and then they provide
you with a nominal user experience along
the way giving you updates on where your
money is both as a sender and a receiver
and the last so the fourth pillar they
talk about is convenience which is kind
of tied into transparency but they're
well known for how phenomenal their user
experience is they've got a 71 net
promoter score which is phenomenal
particularly for a business with
explaining customers and that flows
through so to this day about two-thirds
of all customers are referred by other
customers which again we can talk about
the efficiency of this business but that
show shows you just how many Advocates
they have for their user experience so
that's probably what I would call their
custom value proposition in terms of how
it manifests in products and services
back in the day when they were called
transferwise it was simply a way to
transfer money across borders and that
would be pretty much the only product
you could get from this business over
time they've actually expanded beyond
that and they've tried to create more of
what you might see as a borderless
account so they've got three products
the first is what they call now the wise
account and that allows you to hold send
spend or receive all of those currencies
so they think you should have a
borderless account and these ring fence
domestic bank accounts are of the past
and people will move more towards
borderless accounts the second is
basically the same account but for
businesses so a few more bells and
whistles for small businesses like
creating invoices business cards things
like that and the last which is quite an
interesting part of the business is
called the wise platform and that's
essentially a product that allows other
Enterprises normally Neo Banks but it
could also be other kind of ancillary
services so monzo is a near bank or xero
as a software accounting package they
can white label wise's functionality
into their own features so monzo zero
are both offering their customers plus
border transfers but it's all running on
Wiser's infrastructure I look at the
financials of the business they're
likely to approach over a billion pound
in the next year or two very profitable
and even down margins in excess of 25
percent ish going forward
and then compare them to some of the
scaled businesses that they compete with
who are associated with who tend to grow
at mid to high single digits at lesser
margins if not negative can you just
take me through the unit economics of
this business and how they make these
numbers work
I think if we're comparing it to your
traditional remittance players the
obvious one to think about is Western
Union Western Union I mean there should
probably should be a breakdown of
Western Union itself it's a fascinating
history behind this business founded in
1851 essentially as a telegraph company
it's got a history of basically
Communications and it's added on money
transfers on top of that but this is a
enormous business so it's operating in
200 countries it's got 600 000 agent
locations so the focus of the Western
Union is the ability to do cashed cash
and that typically Services the
remittance Market where you have
unbanked customers who need cash and
aren't able to go through banks so
Western Union has this agent Network
around the world it's got 20 000
currency corridors but it's charging
about a five percent take rate compare
that to wise is it 65 bases point so
that's a very different Top Line number
Western Union flows through to about a
40 gross profit margin compared to why
is it 60 percent the cost of services in
the Western Union model is all related
or largely related to commissions they
pay agents around the world to accept
and disperse cash so there's a very
different cost of service the only cogs
on the wires side are bank and partner
fees where they need to dip into
International money markets but largely
speaking it's much more efficient at
that cost of service line and then in
terms of profitability this is I think
one of the most interesting parts of
wise they run an incredibly efficient
business that allows them to maintain
price at a very low Point yet maintain
about it like you say a 20 25
profitability line so maybe now let's
unpick some of their operating costs and
see how they run this business so
efficiently the first being sales and
marketing so that organic referral
Network they have is incredibly powerful
they used to run growth hacking or
guerrilla marketing stunts to try and
raise awareness of how they basically
are counter positioning the banks in
terms of fees and transparency more
recently they've now got quite a
discipline paid marketing approach where
they look for kind of a less than nine
month payback on paid marketing spend I
think it's currently trending closer to
three months the second this is a really
interesting one is how the way they set
up their bank accounts in the various
domestic markets and the way they
connect in with those National payments
bodies and central banks over time they
try and become more and more vertically
integrated removing any Partners or
intermediaries they had in the time when
they first launched in the market so in
their investor relations materials
you'll see they publish this chart which
shows how they enter the market in quite
a simple structure and then over time
they move up the stack to become more
centrally integrated into the national
infrastructure and become licensed more
fully as a regulated Financial entity by
doing this it removes any partner fees
or kind of the friction of needing to
rely on a partner Bank in that market to
facilitate those domestic transfers
this as they increase this vertical
integration over time again they're
lowering operational costs and the unit
costs in the UK I think it's taken them
almost 10 years to become completely
fully integrated with the national
real-time payment scheme the third area
is their infrastructure and their
technology and how they're digitally
focused and are leaning into things like
machine learning and artificial
intelligence to help their operations
team run more efficiently
so the scale of this business now is the
onboarding or reviewing at least 20 000
customer applications per day and 85
percent of those are returned or
reviewed within one hour so a lot of
this is trying to automate in the back
end and digitize a lot of those
processes as the business scales the
other thing they utilize is AI and
machine learning to help try and
forecast required liquidity pools in the
various domestic countries they operate
in so they don't have to rely on
Partners or go to the international
money markets to get more currency if
there's a shortfall in one particular
Market they use machine learning to try
and estimate where they need liquidity
ahead of time and then manage inflows
and outflows from their bank accounts in
those markets accordingly
so maybe just to put it in simple maths
perspective
for every thousand dollar transfer
Western Unions earning fifty dollars in
fees whereas wise is earning 6.50 so
huge discrepancy the price of the
customer at the Top Line and so in order
for wise to run profitable it has to be
so lean so from that 6.50 it's turning
about a dollar Thirty into earnings and
Western Unions turning there fifty
dollars into ten dollar earnings so
Western Union wants to drop price to say
a four percent tag rate and so make
forty dollars in fees they make nothing
at the ebit.line
so you can see why having this low-cost
model makes wise such a threat in the
market and the other thing to add is
despite only spending five dollars in
Costa Services operating costs on that
transaction why is it still growing as
total income at around 70 this year so
it's at scale I mean it's still less
than four percent market share in the
personal market and it's growing at such
a rapid clip yet it's really not
spending much in comparison to some of
the competitors in Market
and then I guess if we were going to
present it in just as simple terms as
possible there's a take rate associated
with the company but like beyond that
what is the revenue model
if you think about the highest line it's
that total income so they're making
about a billion pounds this year of that
total income that's broken down into two
components so the first is revenue which
is at 90 of that total income and the
next which is fascinating and one that's
emerged recently is net interest income
and maybe we'll come back to that so if
you look at that first bill it just
Revenue eighty percent of that Revenue
line is cross-border revenue so that's a
volume per customer which they do about
five thousand pounds per customer per
quarter roughly in terms of volume and
they're charging that 65 basis point
take rate which is presented to the
customers across border fee up front
that volume split is about 70 personal
so personal users and about 30 business
users so that is their main Revenue
stream and we can go back to a
fascinating part of this business around
what they call Mission zero which is
actually trying to make cross-border
transfers probably which would eliminate
that line item which is very down
intuitive but fascinating so 80 of their
revenue is coming from across borders
but 20 has emerged over say the last
five years what they call just other
Revenue now that's broken down between
debit card interchange so they have a
debit card associated with the account
which then interchange fees on domestic
transfers so people using a borderless
account and transferring within one
jurisdiction and they also have another
product called assets which is a form of
investment product so it allows
customers to basically invest in ETFs so
that's the revenue component
like I said revenue is about 90 of total
income
and then recently they've broken out net
interest income which hasn't really been
a thing in the past but with the rising
interest rates globally they're sitting
on about 10 billion pounds of customer
deposits as interest rates goes up their
yield on those balances are going up and
so in the last quarter there and just
shy of 50 million pounds net interest
income and that's growing at quite a
clip so there's a lot of congaction a
lot of talk about this in the market how
big can that net interest income line
get particularly given why is this
commitment to giving Prof there or
sharing profit
back to customers so they're still
unclear and wiser spoken about how they
are trying to give that interest back to
customers as they're not a bank it's not
that straightforward so that's a
fascinating thing that will play out
over the next say 12 months because you
mentioned it I think there are two
things that we wanted to find one being
just very basic level what are
interchange fees for the benefit of
people who haven't studied them and then
I think project zero as part of the
structure of the firm is fascinating
let's just talk about how that guides
the goals of the business The
Interchange fees are fees that hard
issuers earn when you use a debit card
or a credit card so if you were talking
more in the merchant acquiring Market
here now but you go to your bank a card
gets issued a card issuing Bank bans
interchange fees these are MasterCard
which the card networks sitting in the
middle they work with the issuers on one
side and the merchant acquirers on the
other side and so in this instance wise
is issuing these debit cards to his
customers when customer uses that to buy
something using a card they'll earn a
percentage of that transaction maybe now
to get into what is really fascinating
part of this business is it's Mission
zero why is this set itself up to solve
this problem in the market or this
status quo around
opaque expensive and slow transfers and
the key one being they think
cross-border transfers should be as easy
as sending an email so ultimately
cross-border transfers should be free
and they have said this many many times
they want it to be as low as possible
they give quarterly price updates to
customers where they bemoan the fact
that prices have had to increase due to
volatility they kind of get quite upset
about that they have a very transparent
price comparison tool when you're
considering making a transfer with wise
you can compare it against lots of other
providers in the market and if there's
another provider that's offering a
cheaper rate they'll show that which is
a bit counter-intuitive when you're
trying to compete you've Quantified The
Profit pool the transaction volume which
I believe exceeds a trillion pounds of
potential but why doesn't the entire
industry profitable just get destroyed
by a company that's willing to accept a
key rate that's so much lower than the
industry standard it's an interesting
question if you're an observer from the
side You could argue this Mission zero
that they're on is actually destroying
their primary Revenue stream and
ultimately if they're successful in
achieving their mission the business
doesn't exist anymore you've got to
think about is this Mission zero a kind
of tactical strategic way for them to
counter position the status quo and
build that customer base and then as
they've done expand the engagement of
that customer with ancillary revenue
streams like debit cards and Investments
and ultimately they'll pivot away from
cross-border transfers and it may just
end up being a free service that's
supplemented by lots of other different
features that they can charge for or
they're kind of zealots that want
cross-border transfers be zero and
that's all they really care about and
that's why I think this is a bit of a
Marmite stock or if you're in the UK in
Australia to call it Vegemite stock it's
like kind of love hate is this a
commodity business that only really
competes on price and that will continue
to be eroded down to zero or is it a
shared economy scale business which is
counter position status quo and the
market is so big that the durability
requirements left in this business is
colossal that's why I think the
different perceptions on this business
lie I guess what I'm really trying to
better understand here is the value
proposition makes a ton of sense the
differentiation seems reasonable to me
but what is the core competitive
Advantage they have why can't someone
else just copy their business model on
the one hand money transfer is You could
argue a commodity transferring a US
dollar to a Euro their customer doesn't
really care as long as they get their
euros
well you could argue that this
disjointed network of domestic
currencies that relies on banks talking
to each other creates such a terrible
experience the service and the user
experience wrapped around that
cross-border transfer is really
important and will forever be important
one way we think about competitive
Advantage is using Hamilton helmer's
seven powers and maybe to call out some
of the ones which stand out for us for
wise the first is that classic counter
position or as clay Christian might call
it the invader's Dilemma this is where a
newcomer so wise adopts a different way
a superior way a new way of doing
business which an incumbent in this case
the banks Khan or doesn't want to
respond to or mimic due to the foreseen
damage it will do to its own business
so just from a price perspective wise is
due to their efficient model able to cut
out a lot of that inefficiency so they
can charge 65 basis points and still
earn a 20 margin banks are charging six
seven percent on this and earning a lot
of profitability out of it so Banks can
choose to respond to this but arguably
that counter position is so strong just
from a price perspective are underpinned
by the fact that their infrastructure is
completely different the second one
which I think has built up over 10 years
and will drive a lot of growth going
forwards is this process power around
moving into new markets or new
geographies integrating with the local
payment system so like I said they're in
80 different countries now and what they
do is they land and basically expand on
a regulatory basis so they start with
just a simple bank account set up in the
most simple Financial Services license
they can have and then over time
like in the UK and in Australia they're
actually the first non-banks to be
participants in the National real-time
payments infrastructure so they move
their way up becoming more and more
efficient in terms of that money
transfer infrastructure over time which
allows them to reduce price to the
customer the amount of complexity
they're managing something like 63
different Financial license around the
world they know how to move into a
country they know how to work with local
Regulators that process power I think is
really strong the next one I think the
very strong and is very important that
their brand is well known and trusted
trust is super important for any
financial institution but particularly
if you're not a bank me transferring
money to what it was called transferwise
back in the day was a bit of a leap of
faith you didn't know too much about the
business and over time I think they've
built that trust up and that's shown
through in the word of mouth referrals
and The NPS and the growth of that
customer base I think that brand part is
really important there's also a risk you
know if they mess something up from a
regulatory perspective there's a risk to
that brand and that trust the last one
which I think is the most pivotal part
of this business is scale economies
particularly scale economies shared back
with their customer so wise talks about
the flywheel that they have and this has
existed from the get-go so they created
a what we would say is a better user
experience for the customer that
resulted in volume as they increase
their volume they can reduce their unit
costs the variable cost of transfer
money comes down
they then reinvest that into marketing
which drives more customers new tech new
product to improve the experience which
creates that better experience to their
customers But ultimately they lower the
price
so they give that efficiency they share
that scale economy back to the customer
in the form of a lower price which
drives a better user experience and then
the flywheel starts again so it's this
classic paradoxical thing where they're
growing more by giving more back and by
lowering price this is I think the most
fundamental thing to understand about
wise that that always is trying to drive
the lowest price possible as opposed to
what a lot of companies do which is
focus on profit maximization in the
shorter term where their pricing to the
equilibrium whereby they price as high
as possible without forcing a customer
to leave and seek services from a
competitor this is the most important
thing about wise the other thing we need
to think about or what we think about a
lot is the fact that this business is
incredibly focused on what we would call
a one mission one platform Journey its
entire infrastructure is one platform
it's one code base 99 of it has been
grown organically and it's been the
aggregation of small gains over time so
their focus on maintaining this one
platform despite the fact they have say
personal business it all sits on that
one platform the second is this one
Mission and we've talked about it but
that mission zero they are incredibly
focused on free quick and transparent
cross-border money transfers and if you
talk about the culture and you
understand from people who've worked
there how embedded this is into the
fabric of the organization you start to
get a picture of this isn't just a
mission that they put on their website
this is something they live and breathe
every single day
and you know we're spoken to Chris
though the CEO and co-founder his
argument is the only true competitive
Advantage this isn't the fact that
they're so focused on it and no one else
is I guess when you think about their
competitors I know you mentioned Western
Union I think about the extent that
PayPal plays in the space MoneyGram who
do you think about as their true
competitors Beyond just the global
banking system
like you say they operate in a very
competitive Financial Services space so
if you put the banks to one side which
is about 60 70 of the cross-border
transfer market you've still got these
money transfer operators like Western
Union which have huge amounts of brand
awareness they're colossal in terms of
that agent Network they've been doing it
and talk about process power Western
Union have built this up over a very
long period of time they're about 10 20
in the market but outside of that I
think there are some very threatening
players in the market the first being
card networks so these are a MasterCard
have made serious investments in
cross-border transfers through
acquisition and organic growth they both
have products which allow near real-time
cross-border money transfers linked to
cards so there's a Visa direct the
MasterCard send they have also the
incredible brand awareness they have the
existing Network and they span around
the world they have the relationships
with these Banks and bank accounts so
arguably they have everything in place
to allow them to compete very
strenuously with wise more recently you
also have a budding cohort of fintechs
that are going after this space so
remotely is a digital cross-border
transfer business focused on their
remittance space which is listed
recently Neo Banks such as revolut in
the UK are quite well known for offering
cross-border transfers and they don't
necessarily need to charge for it so one
of the biggest risks I see for wise is
where a business decides to
use cross-border transfers and foreign
exchange is a bit of a lost leader not
charged for it and then cross subsidize
through ancillary revenue streams and
that's what revolut does they charge a
subscription for access to the account
and then you can basically get foreign
exchange or cross-border transfer for
free and then there's in terms of
individual players there's this emerging
threat around social media players so
Twitter and meta or Facebook have both
recently invested in or toyed with
investing in their payments capability
and they also have that Global presence
they also have social media accounts and
if you see the world moving towards a
place where moving money around is it's
easy as sending an instant message then
the social media players represent a
significant threat to this business the
one caveat I would say that Zach is wise
has that white label product we talked
about earlier called wise cloud platform
where any of these players if they don't
want to build it themselves or partner
with bank accounts can partner with wise
utilize the infrastructure that they
built over 10 years and still for all
intents and purpose of their customers
it's a service being offered by them
they don't need to know that it's
underpinned by wise so wise in a way has
reduced its friction of adoption and
ultimately expanded its way of
attracting customers through these
Partnerships
it is interesting right because if you
think about meta Facebook as an example
and specifically WhatsApp believe they
have like a monthly active user base of
over 2 billion you would think the
distribution advantages that they
potentially have could be quite
meaningful for facilitating this type of
value proposition but this company is
scaled in such a way without the benefit
of distribution
how exactly is it that they're able to
acquire customers so efficiently
it goes back to that flywheel two-thirds
of all customers are referred by other
customers which is remarkable
particularly for a business of this
maturity and their size and I think it
goes back to just a phenomenal user
experience they have in the counter
position they have to an existing
process which is broken and so I myself
I've been a user of wires since
2017. I've told loads of people about it
as a Englishman living in Australia the
amount of my friends that I've referred
to why is because it's just such a
better user experience you hear it say a
barbecue I need to transfer money back
to the UK because I've got a mortgage
there or there's an expense I need to
pay I had to go to my bank I had to fill
out a bunch of forms they had no idea
how much it would cost I feel like I got
ripped off and you go well I basically
sign up instantly to a wise account and
then four seconds later the money
appeared minus a small fee in my account
so there is that I don't want to
underplay it but that user experience
Advantage they have alongside price is a
really strong flywheel so two aspects of
the business which are important
somewhat nuanced in many cases a
function of an increasing interest rate
environment are the float of the
business the customer deposits that they
have on hand and then the increasing net
interest margin that they're able to
earn and I'd love to just spend some
time talking about how those two
Dynamics which may not necessarily be
core to the business are actually quite
powerful in enabling them to do what
they are and building the business
that's more durable over the long term
yeah I think the net interest income has
emerged globally is something that we as
investors have to think about as
interest rates have been rising wise
currently sits on about 10 billion
pounds of customer bounces and these are
balances where you're not earning
interest so they're not a bank that
can't pay interest it's kind of lazy
money I myself have US dollars I think
sitting in my wise account which I'll
just leave there until I'm next in the
US these bouncers have been sitting
there earning neither the customer money
nor the company money and now as
interest rates have been rising and wise
as a regulated entity needs to hold
these funds this kind of liquid funds so
they generally just hold them in super
highly rated and conservative accounts
normally with Central Bank they've
started to earn interest on it and the
investment Community has been watching
this unfold I mean four quarters ago it
was basically a net interest loss there
are losing money on this now in the last
quarter alone they earned 50 million or
just shy of 50 million pounds they're on
track to and say
120 million pounds this financial Year
from that alone you'd think the company
is rejoicing that they've got this new
Revenue stream coming on board and it
can flow through to earnings what makes
wise so particular and why it's such a
fascinating business to break down
they've actually complained in earning
calls about this they're like we want to
give this money back to customers but we
don't know how yet because we're not A
banks we can't simply allow customers to
earn interest and so they're trying to
come up with a functional way and build
a functional way of returning some of
this earnings to customers their
interest rates are rising faster than
they can deploy this functionality and
so this operating Leverage is coming
through and they don't know what to do
with the profit I don't know many
examples globally where that's the case
where you hear a c if I talk about them
trying to give money back to the
customer and the way they're kind of
craftily trying to give it back to the
customers without becoming a bank is
allow customers to invest in government
bonds basically so they would be earning
the base rate in interest rate but it
wouldn't be wise paying them interests
they basically moving the money off
balance sheet and earning money through
a different vehicle that's what they're
trying to do the other ways they've
talked about doing it is lowering price
further or form of cash back and other
ways of actually returning what they're
earning to the customer but I think this
is one that in the near term we'll have
to wait and see how it plays out I think
from a valuation perspective you've also
got to think about the quality of these
earnings and the durability of these
earnings versus say cross-border
transfer fees how long does this
interest rate environment last where
does it go and how much ultimately is
why it's going to allow to drop through
through to ebitda versus kind of
returning it all before that the point
you're making there is it would be
inappropriate to put a multiple on the
earning stream associated with that
interest that they're earning because
their intention is to do their best to
reinvest that interest into the customer
experience either by passing it along or
providing incremental Services exactly I
don't think in kind of a sum of the
parts analysis you'd be able to apply
the same earnings multiple on that
Revenue stream as you would to say
they're called business but we'll see
and so if I kind of look across the
strategy of the business lower prices
more transparency ease of use all these
things
tend towards the ability to continue to
grow and to take share but what would
you kind of identify as some of the key
risks associated with the business or
potentially the tail risks that you'd
identify in evaluating this company
the first I would call out is what we've
said around if there is a paradigm shift
with how people around the world think
about money and transfer money so is
this a commodity business that is
arbitraging a broken system of Fiat
currencies closed within their domestic
countries that don't talk to each other
and you rely on this kind of hodgepodge
connection of monks talking to each
other sitting on a network of electronic
communication if that shifts and one way
that that is Shifting real time is
countries are modernizing their payments
infrastructure so people may have heard
of real-time payments or instant
payments where Financial authorities are
upgrading from batch payments that rely
on a kind of archaic technology to
real-time technology that allows money
to move instantly they are actually
upgrading the data format the payments
information is exchanged and making that
more consistent globally and so you
don't get that translation layer issue
between countries what countries are
doing are examples of this particularly
with Singapore they've interlinked or
working on interlinking their domestic
payments infrastructure within other
countries so Singapore has done this or
is doing this with India and Thailand
and there are other examples around the
world whereby we basically plugging in
the Singaporean real-time infrastructure
with the Indian real-time infrastructure
and then it basically is the same
functionality as transferring internally
you've got to think about foreign
exchange but from a functional
perspective you can transfer money
across borders as easily as you can
functionally internally within those
borders so that interlinking I think
represents a bit of a risk to the
business one of the biggest talking
points of this business going forwards
is around whether you believe money will
be transferred or value will be
transferred across border digitally and
people won't necessarily need to hold or
maintain Fiat currencies one of the big
threats this business is that Paradigm
Shift towards say digital currencies
whether that be private so potentially
stable coins or Central Bank digital
currencies where central bank money so
digital cash is distributed around the
world and this isn't kind of a paper
tiger there's reports that around 90 of
all central banks globally are
researching or experimenting with
Central Bank digital currencies so I
think this may play out over time but
one of the things you've got to think
about is that wise is basically
via money transfers between existing
bank accounts and if that Paradigm
doesn't really exist anymore or is
completely disrupted so not Faster
Horses but cars if there is a complete
shift in the way that money is
transferred across borders that
represents a big threat to wise the last
one which I think we've also touched on
which is a big one for me is the surface
area of risk for this business from a
regulatory perspective is only growing
they're already maintaining 63 licenses
Financial Services regulation and
complexity has really increased since
the GFC and continues to do so and
there's a particular focus on anti-money
laundering and counterterrorism
financing and the ability to know your
customer identify that customer and
monitor transactions related to that
customer going forward that is a huge
burden to most Financial Services
businesses and I wouldn't underestimate
how if you're maintaining 63 licenses is
with 63 different nuances to those
licenses how the risk for this business
increases from a regulatory perspective
last year I think it was they were fined
by the Abu Dhabi Financial authorities
for not having appropriate controls in
place it was a small fine and it was an
isolated incident and the company
fronted up to it and were very open and
transparent about it which is a great
sign but I think a regulatory risk has
to be on anyone's mind when they think
about this business
and you mentioned that they made the
decision to list in the UK via direct
listing and you just talk a little bit
about the decision to do so and how they
went about listing in a way that's
non-traditional a direct listing is
whereby you don't actually raise any
money through an IPO and you basically
take your stock and Lister on a public
exchange so wise did this in 2021 it's
atypical there are a couple of high
profile examples I think slack did it
Spotify also did it I guess it comes
down to the incentives and the rationale
for listing in the first place often
companies do it to raise Capital if you
don't need Capital there are other
reasons you might want to list two
obvious ones being you want to increase
the liquidity for existing shareholders
and the ability to buy and sell on a
regular basis and the other is and I
think Christo alluded to this at the
time is to increase awareness and
ownership of your company so I think
there's this altruistic sense within
Christo that he wants more people to be
exposed to wise because he thinks that
he's solving a really important problem
and I think he likes the idea of
customers owning part of the business
and I guess it goes back to that scale
economy shared thing where he wants to
Share value back but the customer he
doesn't feel like this needs to be a
profit maximization business in the
short term I'd also add maybe the
benefit of being public helps with the
brand awareness and thus when you're
acquiring customers being more of a
household brand certainly helps I think
another interesting aspect of it is
studying this company for the benefit of
this conversation candidly I never heard
of it and despite of business it's going
to be doing in excess of a billion
dollars in revenue and payment transfers
well in excess of presumably 100 billion
at some point it's just quite
interesting you spot on Zach for a
business like we've said so reliant on
contrast the more people that know their
story and being a publicly listed
company I think adds to that trust I was
part of a business that listed in 2019
and it was one of the main reasons it
was also a financial services business
and when you're going into rfps or
you're talking to customers if they can
see your techronic Stock Exchange there
is added brand trust there so I know
that when looking across their investor
materials the way that they back into
their margin is unique in what they're
managing to I believe it's around 20
percent how should people looking at the
business think about where margins go
over time and if there will ever be an
environment where they want them to
exceed that or on the flip side lower
the margin further to continue to
reinvest in the customer experience
the great question I think it's one of
the most topical things that's discussed
by investors or observers of this
business like you say they manage the
business to a twenty percent ebitda
margin in a way this is artificial so
like I said before they take a third of
their gross profit and spend on keeping
the lights on they take a third of it
into growth and put it into growth and
marketing and a third falls through to
ebitda which is where that 20 comes from
back in 2021 during the pandemic they
actually pulled back on some of that
growth spend to be a little bit more
conservative as the world didn't really
know what was going on and there it
would imagine for that year spiked to 26
it gives you an indication that there is
some underlying earnings power to the
business that they are deliberately
choosing not to allow to come through at
this moment because they're so focused
on growth and so on a long-term
perspective if you think about how big
this Tam is and how durable the growth
of this business can be utilizing that
scale economy shared flywheel when and
how big that earnings margin goes I
think is one for debate if you look at
it on paper if they were to stop
altogether that growth spend which is a
third of gross profit and basically
could double even 58 so that margin goes
from 20 to 40 if they just completely
pulled back on growth and marketing so
do they do that eventually or do they
just decide to ultimately continue to
lower price until they get to that
mission zero I think that's why it's
such a Marmite or Vegemite stock but for
us as really long-term investors we just
think how long can this business grow
for and we think for a very very long
time you know you're talking on a
10-year basis I think they've got so
much Headroom and that flywheel is so
strong that at some point they may flip
it into kind of a profitability scenario
but the one thing I think people need to
think about is just don't underestimate
how long this business can grow for and
then as you kind of reflect upon what
you've learned about this business as
you studied it and the broader payment
space what is a lesson that you can take
from this business and apply to others
from an Investor's perspective and then
some of the other early stage or late
stage growth companies that you look at
what are lessons you'd like to see them
borrow from Wise and apply to their own
businesses operators
the one thing we haven't really touched
upon which I think wise has and being
that separated myself is something that
I could have learned from
the way they organize their people and
prioritize their culture I think is
relatively unique I tended to talk with
someone from transferwise back in 2018
who talked about the way they
prioritized resource allocation
internally so what they have is they
have small teams so they have over I
think it's over 100 teams small highly
autonomous empowered cross-functional
teams each working on a solution or a
feature and that team is empowered to
create its own Vision its own mission
its own objectives to the extent it can
even go and seek its own legal advice so
it's fully or powered each team is fully
autonomous and they basically Vie for
prioritization amongst each other so
it's a lot of mini businesses within a
business why I think that is fascinating
it has some problems which essentially
we can touch on but why that resonates
with me is the thesis around having very
highly aligned very Loosely coupled
people within your organization to
overcome this inertia and this slowdown
that occurs as a business gets bigger so
if you have
low alignment and high autonomy
you have very empowered silos but
they're doing their own thing they might
not be pulling in the same direction
there's probably some duplication or
overlap or potentially even pulling in
opposite directions
on the flip side you can have very high
alignment below autonomy which is
basically a command and control type
structure both of these can exist and do
exist quite regularly but they really
struggle to scale read Hastings talks
about this High alignment loose coupling
where you tell people what to do not how
to do it and I think this is what these
small mini businesses within a business
is what wise has managed to organize as
they've grown up
and key to it is having that super clear
Mission super Clear Vision you've got
your customer at the center of
everything you know why you exist and
that creates the alignment there's a
huge amount of trust and transparency
within the business and I think this
culture focusing on one thing you see it
in other scale economies shared
businesses there's been great breakdowns
on Floor and Decor or Costco where it's
a Relentless focus on one thing
returning operational improvements and
the benefit of unit cost efficiencies
back to the customer but it is that one
thing focused and just doing that one
thing really well and organizing a
culture behind it for us as people and
culture investors that is so powerful
and I think it's one of the untold
stories of this business well James
thank you for joining us to break down
Wise It's a fascinating business that
many ways seems early in its Evolution
that positive aspects of lowering prices
increasing transparency and providing a
service that's needed seemed like a
recipe for success and it seems like the
business is doing exceptionally well

hey everyone welcome back to another Deep dive on today's episode we're going to be looking at WISE PLC formerly
transfer wise and if you haven't heard of this company I wouldn't blame you they've been focused on moving money Without Borders for the last 13 years
and we're going to dive into the fundamentals of the business their competitive advantages and also look at the valuation so let's Dive Right In
shall we so as with all great businesses they started with solving a problem for
themselves they were two Estonian friends one cryistal Carmen and the other Tava henrikus and one was living
in London and one was living in Estonia and they wanted to transfer money the other way and they were just a standard
with I guess how much it was costing them and they thought there must be a better way to do this so what they decided was their light bulb moment was
like uhuh you have money in London I have money in Estonia I'll just send you kind of like a peer toer system and that
was almost like a Napster back in the day I'm probably giving away how old I am but that was the essence of the
business and with the backing of notable investors like Peter theel andrion harwitz and Richard Branson they got
their start in 2011 in London so let's look at the four key value drivers for this business why is


this aiming to be the lowcost provider and the fastest at transacting across borders for their customers thirdly they
want to also be the most transparent because there's a lot of hidden fees that customers are not aware of and
banks are notorious for this and fortly they want to have the largest multicurrency coverage across the globe
so those are four things that they're focusing on but two of those are probably the most important which are going to be low cost and speed and an
anecdote from GIF Bay is was once he was asked about well what were 10 you know in 10 years what could change about
customer behavior and he inverted the question to ask well what's not going to change about customer Behavior they're
always going to want low cost and they're always going to want things fast so if wise is able to deliver at least on two of those four drivers for their
business they're going to have at least a decent amount of success I believe so let's dissect the problem that wise is
trying to solve now these problems are still persistent today despite them being present for 13 years
if you were to go to your bank today to say you want to send money to another bank somewhere in Europe let's say and
you're in America then it's highly unlikely that your bank in America and the bank in Europe have a direct
connection with each other they're going to be using some intermediary banks in between and that was likely going to be
the Swift corresponding banking system that is a system that has been built upon let's say a network of 11,000 Banks
whereby where you send money to the next person they would send it on to the next person it's almost like six degrees of
separation between people I know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy and yeah that works but is it actually efficient
in this day and age where things are very digital um what tends to happen is that when you send money there's a lot
of hidden fees and if we look at this basically you are the original sender you're sending money across to your bank
there's going to be more than one bank and they might have to connect to the Swift Network and then format the data and then actually double check whether
or not this you know transaction is fraudulent is it money laundering is it through terrorism that and that costs
money to in order to abide by all the regulations that are in place and every Bank in between wants to take a share of
the pie so whenever you send money you're usually unaware exactly what you're going to get at the other end
even though that you even if you looked at the currency conversion rate you'd find that whatever you get at the end is
a lot less than what you expect the business has evolved a lot as we said from their initial founding however they
did start with expats and focused on more the high value expat in terms of the amount of volume they would send as
opposed to let's say a few 100 pounds they were looking at more like thousands and thousands of pounds so that has
since changed and now they're targeting small to medium businesses multimedia Enterprises financial institutions as
well and they have some key partners and we'll discuss the banks as well but some of those banks are in major tree Banks
whenever they can't reach a person on the other end they would still use those they haven't completely gotten rid of those
and it's not a pure peer-to-peer system as they originally uh conceived the idea
uh they also pair it with some payment processors as well such as well MasterCard uh Visa possibly Aden as well
and uh like but you know we're going to discuss that as well in the later part of the video but the key ones here are
going to be the financial Regulators uh let's say whichever country they enter
they need to make sure that they're licensed and approved by the financial authorities in that country in order to
be able to send and receive money abroad and that plays a huge part into their actual let's say mo if you were to say
they have one in that regard okay as far as their key resources that theyve built through those 13 years since they're
founding their payment rails would probably be number one there because without this nothing functions because
they have a highly skilled team of Engineers 800 of them or so at this stage and they are the ones that are
powering this network of sending and receiving money but without the regulatory licenses again nothing would
function so they need this kind of pairing of like we're going to be um let's say going and lobbying in a way
with these um you know uh financial institutions in order to get these
regulations and approvals that we need in order to you know gain a larger share of the network uh the other thing is the
banking Partnerships they will continuously keep needing to gain more partners and you'll see how that evolves
throughout the story as we discuss it more so the last thing I would say is the brand achieving you know the high
status and trust is a you know a thing that takes time and they've built this upon layer on layer of you know trust
and gaining you know you know more let's say they're focused on transparency number one and the customers probably
are appreciating that more and more so however you could say there's an argument that most customers are not
that price sensitive towards these hidden fees and they get away with a lot of these banks for a long time so it it
will take time to you know teach and raise awareness in terms of what benefit it is to you know come and become a
customer wise but uh I think over time this will become a larger driver for the


business so let's bring everyone up to speed from their founding to now as to what's happening with wise as we said
wise started off just as a money withit company peer-to-peer you know transferring however since then they've
evolved a lot 2016 they started focusing on gaining approvals across the globe they started with the UK and gained
approval from the financial conduct Authority and since then they've lost lached a few Key Products which is the
wise account which allowed them to hold customer funds as opposed to just transferring money and since then they've introduced the wise card which
is a means for them to you know just transact or you know use a card for day-to-day purposes as opposed to just
transferring and then they've rebranded to wise and got listed in the London Stock Exchange and since then they've
gained more and more key Partners across the globe as opposed to just intermediate banks these Banks such as
new Banks if you've heard of them a very exciting Bank in South America uh would Ed the wh label version of their payment
rails and they' were working with standard and Charter as well as Morgan and Stanley recently the key one here I like to highlight is the Swift
partnership and that is a Vindication I would say a validation of what they've built to say that Swift is partnering
with them well we started off disrupting this and now they're partnering with us because they can't build anything better
than what we have I think that's a strong Vindication of what they've built and the the strength of their payment
rails and their Network so what about their key products now we've touched upon why's account


already so it's basically a account that they can hold funds in and transfer money whenever they need it why's
business is almost identical except just adds invoicing whenever businesses need to send invoices to customers and wise
platform that's basically the Partnerships they're build building with the white labeling Solutions and I can
see this expanding more and more over time and it's an exciting business because there's more avenues for you
know services and products that they can deliver to customers the only thing I would add here potentially is a fourth product is the wise card and we'll
discuss that shortly so wise is now generating 56% of their revenue from crossb payments if
you had told the co-founders probably in 2011 that they were doing half of their money from crossb payments and the rest
from something else they probably be just a surprise because you know that was not what you expected the evolution
of this business to be but given the Tailwinds that we've seen recently as well with the large spike in interest
rates you've seen their interest income ballooning to 26% and that's just based
on the amount of funds that customers are holding they want to generate some cash or income from that money so they give them a portion of that back and the
rest they pocket additionally they have 18% coming from card revenue and other sources and here you can see how the
evolution of the revenue has been over time for the last couple of quarters I didn't want to go all the way back
because the way they were disclosing this information has changed so I went only as far back as when they started disclosing card and other Revenue but
over time what you're noticing is that the card percentage Revenue has has gone up from about let's say 16% up to 23% so
this is a growing part of their business as well as a net interest income you can see that this is a growing portion of
their business as well so that could be the case and it's just something that we also need to be uh mindful of is that
interest income or interest rates may change over time and that might have a you know significant effect on this
business and how it's being valued so I've gotten this slide from the investor presentation deck of the
last year and there's a few things going on but I've blanked out a few the less important ones the key things to focus on here are that 63% of payments are
instant and that's within 20 seconds let's say there's not a lot of businesses that are able to do this in this field so that they're able to
deliberate huge value to the customer the other thing is that 40 currencies are available right now and we'll touch
on that a little bit later they also have one Global treasury function which basically let's say they've kind of
conceded the fact that they can't be a peer-to-peer system whereby you have one person on one side and then another
person on the other side and they just swap money across because the nature of remittance and how money is being
transferred worldwide is not so bidirectional in nature therefore it's not a one:1 ratio sometimes if you look
at the corridors where money is being transferred specifically the largest Corridor of them all which is the USA
Mexico border most money is being transferred let's say 60 billion one way and only five billion goes the other way
so they need to have a way to balance out that difference in terms of when people need to send money to the other
side and that's where they have the liquidity function fun available in order to do that they also gained 65
licenses which you know across the globe that's just another part of their mot in terms of the regulatory you know system
that they've developed the most important thing I want to focus on on this slide is the last thing which is
the direct connections they have six direct connections to the actual central banks of the countries they're operating
in right now six of those and two on the way and I can't stress this enough how
important those connections are to their MO and their competitive advantage that they're building so they can reach up to
in in theory right now 40 direct connections which is basically for each country had its own currency they
develop one direct connection and one of those is actually to you know Europe or the Euro so that covers the entire you
area of Europe as well so let's look into that a little bit further and why that's so important now what you'll see here is
that um the banks themselves are you know Euro England Hungary Australia I
think that's Singapore Indonesia I'm should probably say it's Indonesia and then Philippines as well so those six
direct connections with two more incoming that allows them to drive their costs down and the most important thing
as we said in terms of value for the customer is a lower transaction fee if you're able to build a direct connection
with these Banks and therefore bypass the intermediat banks that you were
working with prior therefore you're rising up that food chain in terms of vertical integration within the country
they might enter a new country with a partner bank that would they need but then eventually they work and gain trust
within that system and develop that direct connection where possible with those with those central banks and
therefore reducing their costs as you've seen in the UK by nine times and then you know instant transfers would rise as
they did in Australia from 24 to 83% so those are some really really important
competitive advantages that are not easy to replicate and take time and take a lot of trust but as they gain these you
know uh regulatory approvals it kind of builds a critical mass whereby more and more people are willing to work with
them just as you might see as well with the banking Partnerships they've developed on their wise platform as more
Banks sign up as more people adopt their rails therefore it becomes easier and easier and this thing can you know
Snowball out of control and it's also evident from the metrics as we've seen that their 63% of
their transactions are now instant now could this number keep Rising sure it
could become 80% or so that's just another way that they're driving you know value to customers the other thing
is we haven't mention these specific words but they call them out in their actual investor presentations is that
their take rates are going down the take rate is actually made up of two things the mid-market currency rate as well as
the fee on top of that now with normal Banks they charge they would never
charge you a mid-market currency rate because a mid-market is basically the bid ask spread and it's divided by two
whatever it is so basically whatever the range is they're going to give you the one that's in the middle and that's what you usually see if you were to type it
into Google that's the mid-market rate and that is the rate that wise tries to give you whereas if you were going to
your bank or let's say using other remittance Services uh they might give you a little bit higher it's not to say
that they're lowest provider in all of the you know uh let's say corridors where money's being transferred but in
general over let's say an average they have the lowest you know take rate
across a lot of competitors and you'll see that later in a few slides when we'll look at that and they've also
gained increase in volume transfers especially to India that's very important India is a huge Corridor for
money transfer especially from let's say the UAE to India or the US to India it
is a very very lucrative Corridor that they're trying to get a little bit more exposure to as opposed to where they
started off in Europe and here you see the the wise platform which we've not discussed a lot
we've mentioned new bank but their connections to these Banks and white labeling Solutions they're providing um let's say they've worked
with Google pay interactive brokers Apple pay new bank and a few of the Key Banks monzo and n26 these were early
adopters have gained a lot of traction since then and as such they gain you know extra value or Revenue whenever
they are actually making money as well so let's take a closer look at what
No text
things are like so with in terms of Revenue uh geography and where they're making the most Headway obviously they
started they had their start in Europe so you could expect that to be slowing down but actually that's not the case
you could say that yes it's a little bit slower in London at 28% but that's very
respectable for four-year ker of growth that's beyond you know you know let's say 90th percentile in terms of what you
would expect a company to be growing at that rate of that size and uh therefore again Europe's growth at 33% ker you
have North America growing at 33% so that's compounded annual grow grow rate each year they're growing 33% year on
year and as you've seen with their partnership with newbank that's the rest of the world Revenue falls under that
area as well South America but Asia Pacific that's the UAE to possibly India Corridor or Japan um you know the
Philippines that's another lucrative area for them can I see an area of weakness so far and those growth rates
not really they're doing well in all areas actually so we focused on the revenue
per customer but now let's look at the volume per customer how much is each customer s sending and over time let's
say the general trend has been that crossb volume is not slowing down it's still growing at a rapid rate there was
a slight little you know wobble towards the you know Financial year of 2024 but that's you know continued to tick
upwards being driven a lot by the revenue from the business or the volume by from businesses however the volume
from personal customers seems to you know at first glance look like it's going down however the reason they
disclose why that appears to be the case is because the you know personal customers who hold cards and are not
transacting or just using those accounts either to gain interest or just you know for their day-to-day habits is are not
transacting in terms of volume so that's driving the volume per customer down so it's nothing to worry about and I don't
think it's aetric they actually will continue to disclose because it's quite deceiving in terms of what it's showing
but I thought I'd just show you some of the data that you might not be getting elsewhere at this stage so let's recap I
know there's a lot of numbers but these are important things to understand about this business the size of this business they've got 12.8 million customers
they've grown 5.4 million new customers in 2024 um and now they're having 118
billion in crossb volume as well as operating in 160 countries and supporting 40 currencies those are the
key things to understand so as far as their Capital allocation strategies again there are four things that we can


do with capital as allocators we can either choose to invest in higher roic projects so higher return or invested
capital projects to gain a better return we can either choose to you know give a dividend or buy back some shares to
increase the value to shareholders or we can choose to do some mergers or AC
Acquisitions if an opportunity arises or we can pay down debt those are the four things that we can do so from those four
pillars of capital application strategies which ones are they currently pulling on well the main one they're focused on is improving their roic and
that the way they go about this is improving the infrastructure rails they currently have building direct connections with central banks across
various currencies and also improving their product development cycle and that ultimately leads leads to you know A
reduced pricing and increase in volume that they're delivering uh for their customers and that obviously is the
feedback group that drives higher ryc uh the other things they could be focusing on is some mergers and Acquisitions but
at this stage because of their growth rates I'd love to see them grow much much larger before they take on any of those risky bets they could also choose
to pay down some debt but they don't really have that much debt to speak up it's minuscule at this stage or they
could choose to go and you know pay a dividend or buy back shares now they are
doing one of those which is they are paying buying back some shares however
it's only to offset the dilution they're having from stock-based conversation and we'll get on to that a little bit later
in the video so what about the culture and management of this business now Crystal Carman is the CEO and co-founder


of wise as you recall there were two estonians one of them has since left but Chrystal Carman has been leading the
charge and he's actually a very sign ific shareholder of the business as well with 18% shares outstanding he does also
have special voting rights so there are those pesky Class A and Class B shares so that's something to be aware of but I
guess as an investor that in this business you would just have to bear that in mind uh Emmanuel Thomson is the
CFO and he used to work for delivery hero and he helped them through their IPO but you can't judge this man on this
business yet however he does come with some you know good credentials as well harson is the CTO I guess you can't also
really judge him much but this is the seite team he was in charge during a period where Christo went on a sabatical
for 3 months when his son was born so he could say that he could hold the RS for the business at least for the time being so uh this is the team so far and it's
good to see that the approval ratings for christop Carman sit at 80% and as well that 73% would recommend working
there these aren't Stellar numbers but at least it's not bad I would say so what about the culture of this business
now business I would never usually spend a lot of time looking at culture I know that probably is a fault of mine because it's really hard to dissect the culture
but you can see that actually for wise it's a lot easier to dissect because you know the net promoter scores are
fantastic they're some of the best in the business as well as they're very transparent you know as we discussed in
their actual transaction fees they're very transparent about that but they're also very transparent about their road maps they're sharing their road maps
publicly and that just shows like you know this is what I want we want to be judged on we have providing you our
actual road map in terms of what we're planning we want to reduce pricing we want to improve coverage speed and I I
feel like as a competitor I'd be terrified of a company trying to show me everything they have as if they're saying you know you know come and get us
the other thing is you know the culture they've got some weird you know I guess finished things which is in their
headquarters they've got a sauna and that just shows you I guess there there's a fun playful element to the company as well so they've got this
thing now this was a run they did this actually unlisted video so you know you're getting some really sneak peeks
here in terms of what they're doing but they started this naked run and you know I guess the culture there is a bit of
there's a lot of seriousness but at the same time a lot of fun so it's good to see that this is is actually some of the things you'll get as an employee in this
business that it's a fun place to work so on to the financials we focused
No text
a lot about the fundamentals of the business I want to focus now on the on the financial because sometimes this is the area where most people slip up with
a company like this especially fex so I've tried to break it down as simply as possible in terms of how we should look
at these numbers all right so let's get into it so I've broken down the financials into two funds you have the
IFRS reported numbers which are is the European standardized account methodology versus how you would have it
in the US as Gap reported numbers you may be familiar with that and then you have the wise reported numbers which is
present in their annual reports as well the main key difference here is that the top line is completely different and it
changes the whole funnel all the way down wise as a company is very worried about the fact that their net interest
income is ballooning to such a large amount and it's accounting for such a large portion of the revenue that ultimately it's a very volatile part of
the business that they are concerned eventually will plummet and then the business valuation will change dramatically so what they've changed as
of last year is they only recognize 1% of the net interest income they make and
the remainder is being paid out to shareholders and the rest of it will be retained we'll cover that in a little
bit more detail but basically that's the Crux of it is that they're only recognizing 1% of their net interest
income whereas in the IFRS reported numbers they need to recognize the whole net interest income that they collect
and that's where the discrepancy lies which of those numbers should you trust should you actually look at the numbers
they're actually collecting in terms of cash into their Bank into their accounts or should you look at their all this is
what we're kind of like our conservative numbers are going to be I think you need to be somewhere in between because you
know the target 1% may not be so real realistic to say that interest rates are ever going to go down to 1% but
somewhere in between that range let's say a free cash flow between 487 and 247
maybe where things normalize next next let's look at the
gross margins for this business now what you can see here is that their gross margins have been ticking upward which
is fantastic their operating margin has been ticking upwards even faster where could those numbers end up I can't see
this company being as you know a competitor let's say to Visa or Mastercard with their 97% and 100%
margins however could they reach a high of a you know 90% gross margin that's a possibility for this business and it
means there a little bit more room for growth in that metric at least before we go down to the oper
efficiencies so this is another funny chart to look at because this just shows us where the free cash flow is
ballooning out of proportions but the reason that it's appearing so is because of the large customer balances they're
holding and that's why it's so difficult to Value some of these fexs you need to I guess account for that and the change
in networking Capital that's happening so I do go ahead and adjust for that and I'll show you what that effect has on
their free cash flow so a brief look at some of the key financials that tell a story now now I
wanted to paint a picture for everyone here because sometimes you get lost in numbers 45% Revenue growth rate for the
last 4 years compounded and 112% net income compounded for the last
four years as well as current assets which are the customer balances have been growing at 48% for the last four
years ker so those are fantastic numbers I mean those are just huge huge numbers
and the other thing to point out is the ryc the return on invested capital for
this business you probably won't find this number on one of the you know Financial websites because I've had to
adjust this number myself so we've netted out the customer balances in order to arrive at 52% ryc and that's a
fantastic number given their cost of capital let's say approximately 10% it is approximately 10% actually um this is
a fantastic you know return uh for this business and then when you net out the excess net income that they're getting
you get a rate return on Equity of 36% with an interest coverage ratio which shows you how uh let's say how much they
can cover the cost of their uh debt they can cover their cost or their debt very very well um so this business is you
know ticking on all gears and it's doing fantastically well so let's look at some
of the other things to focus on here which is the shares outstanding shares outstanding have been growing steadily
very very slow growth of 1% and I am not too worried about they are offsetting some of of that dilution as we said
because whatever excess net interest income they're making uh they're putting that into an employee benefit fund I
guess trust and buying shares back and giving it to the employees so you're seeing a slight uptick but for 1%
dilution I am not too worried um in terms of the growth rates they're having and you can see the orange line is the
shareholder yield return which is the dividend yield which they don't have any plus their buyback yield uh plus any net
issuance of debt uh as well but you know that number I'm very very happy with they're around 4% in terms of their
buyback at this stage so that's pretty good so let's look at the competitive


landscape in the actual remittance and money moving uh business now we discussed Swift as the Traditional Bank
tool for moving money but you have to deal with one of the juggernauts or incumbents in Western Union which is
moving a lot a lot of volume across the world and mostly smaller volume or at least volume per customer than wise
because they're dealing with remittance to poorer countries uh but they have been around for a very very long time
and as such you know they've because they rely on cash transactions as opposed to digital for most of their um
you know volume they have to have ways to manage that cash and keep that cash safe and regulations and all such so
their gross margins around 40% versus uh wise's 80% so you can see a huge
difference already from the Topline you know gross margins H that wi is doing a lot better the other things to look at
here is one of their main competitors is going to be remit Le so that's one of the competitors in the US and they have
been growing as well rapidly in that space but we'll get to see how they compare to wise soon enough as far as
some of these other ones which are we've already discussed them new bank monzo n26 these are all partners of wise but
they do they already use the white label solution whereas Revue actually is another Neo bank but they don't use uh
WIS Solutions just yet uh but they allow their transactions to be uh free cross
borders and allowing that to be a loss leader for them in order to recruit and get these customers on board uh so
that's just the whole I guess landscape right now it's not all-encompassing but just to shed light on a few of the things there and you might also have
seen the logo for Zoom which is a PayPal tool to transact but they charge such high fees I don't even think it's worth
mentioning at this stage I don't think that's a very successful one so how are these companies doing
quarter by quarter in terms of moving volume of money across the globe now let's take a look at the volume
excluding the US I believe this is the chart for and you can see that wise is growing so fast in comparison to the
incumbent which is Western Union and Western Union has split up into let's say overall and digital but just let's
look at the overall regardless of which way you look at it wise is the fastest gr and the second closest competitor is
Ria which I didn't mention earlier and then you have remitly here Rising fast as well but in terms of just volume
there's no competition between Western Union and and uh wise as well so let's
look at the other chart we have here which is just the USA outbound consumer volume so again we said one of the
biggest corridors is going to be the USA to Mexico Corridor and you can see that
this is a weakness of wise so far is that they're not really challenging that space But again that's a good thing
because otherwise the there's no room to grow and there's no room for further investment or returns so you're going to
see that they have room to grow in that area to take market share away uh but they need to displace remitly as well or
even gain market share from remitly whether or not they're able to do that I don't think it's you know the thesis is going to be built around just the US
there's so much more money around the world to be moving and as well mentioned all the other corridors as well sorry
everyone I added this slide later on in making the video because I forgot to include it initially this just shows us
the take rates for wise versus the competition and as you can see there's no real competition in that regard uh
their take rate is order of magnitude less than nearest competitor I think the reason they are able to get away with
this is because their crossb volume amounts are much larger than their nearest competitors and as such they can
compete at such a low level of a take rate so another chart here that highlights the benefits of working with WIS and their operating efficiency is
they've started to leverage AI in terms of making the onboarding of customers a lot easier you can see the amount of
minutes it takes to register and the amount of time it takes to transfer money it's by far faster like I know
it's we're talking about minutes here but it really does make a difference for some of these customers who just want the quickest and easiest tool to
transact so let's wrap things up by talking about the competitive advantages of this business now what we can see
No text
here with the Hamilton Helmer framework is that there are definitely elements of scale economy for this business because
the more volume you have the lower you can drive your take rate and you create a barriers to entry to any competitor
specifically a barrier to success I don't think it takes a lot of you know money to start in this business however to be as successful as them as having
the lowest take rate that really does mean that you need to be competing at that level the other thing is there's a
huge element of counter positioning here which I'm just makes me really happy because finding counter positioning uh businesses is a little bit more
difficult um the fact is that these Banks incumbents who have been present for a very long time will be canalizing
their own businesses and if you know about the inovator Dilemma that these businesses if they were to say instead
of charging their High fees had to you know bypass all the other Banks and charge low fees that would just eat up
into their margins and revenue and they didn't want to do that they didn't want to take the small take rate when they're taking a big piece of the pie so that's
where they have been able to build the name for themselves where Banks didn't want to venture into the other thing is
they do have a coordinate resour coordinate resources at this stage I believe because those payment rails are
magic they are being used and being validated by Swift using them they're being validated by the other Banks
themselves not being able to build them because a lot of criticism that wise has gotten is the fact that oh any Bank any
other you know financial institution could just build it and bypass them well they have it they've been actually Banks
such as HBS HSBC has actually you know tried to launch one and then failed and floundered so you can see that they're
built something there that is you know built on 13 years of work and they have the hardly one of the largest you know
engineering um Workforce available in I think the world and they have 800 Engineers working on this project so a
cornered resource in terms of the infrastructure in terms of the regulation and direct connections with
these central banks and the Trust buil In I think that's a very very key uh you know cornered resource that they have so
as far as right now having three key competitive advantages I could have given them as well something about Network economies peer-to-peer however
the value of an additional let's say node on the system does not really increase by an increasing of one and as
we said this is no longer a peer-to-peer system they are working now with liquidity providers and you know hedging
positions and all that so that's not a big you know driver in terms of competitive advantages I could have
given them as well let say processing power and that they've been able to drive everything lower and efficiencies
but we'll wait another couple of years before we consider that as far as brand the brand is definitely being trusted
it's gaining Word of Mouth uh trusted at the financial level trusted at the customer level and it's one of those
things I would say definitely starting to gain traction for the last thing to say is again to wrap it up is the
willingness to sell so willingness to sell usually is not as clear as willingness to pay but willingness to
sell means that the financial Regulators are willing to provide them the direct connections because they've shown uh
that trust and that is something that's not easy to gain in this in this market uh the other thing is the willingness to
pay so customers are definitely willing to pay because the take rates are going lower and lower and they are you know
they have this uh mission of driving these take rates really almost close to zero but I've never seen them actually
say that out loud but they're just you know maniacal about driving the take rate lower so there are five key risks


for this business business that have wrapped up the regulatory risk is basically built on trust if there is any breach of that trust they could be fined
they could have their direct connections cut and it's not unforeseeable that these things happen because legislation
politics does play a part in this things of this nature it's unpredictable so there could be an element of regulatory
risk the other thing is EIC currency risks so basically they haven't managed to hedge positions there's a change in
interest rates things do play a part in that regard so interest rate risk we did discuss as well the fact that there
could be some headwinds moving forward interest rates may dip and we'll look at a chart about how that could affect them
in the future uh partnership deterioration so let's say for one example that their white label Solutions
are no longer servicing the banks as they need to or maybe they see them as a competitive threat and they're like no
no we're no longer going to be using you because you're displacing US banks that could be a potential issue the other thing is potential disruption and de
globalization if the world you know heads towards a state whereby let's say Indians I've read something somewhere
Indians were being kicked out at least the ones that were coming um illegally but you know let's say legally they're
saying oh no we're going to onshore everything and everyone's going to onshore everything money across the borders could decrease that's a
theoretical risk I don't believe it's going to be a huge thing the other thing is the disruption part of that so
disruption by digital currencies so it could be the case everyone's been vouching for stable coins and banks have
been rallying around this idea of researching whether or not they want to create a Central Bank coin for each
country so guidance what is the company guiding to at this


stage well we can see here is that they're seeing really good growth in their business and the underlying income
which is their Top Line uh their revenue all including the total income from the
interest as well uh that's about 15 20% they're guiding to how long for I couldn't tell you exactly that but their
profit margins they're estimating will be 13 to 16% so it will tick down from
where it currently is around 20% or so because they're saying that this is what's going to normalize that so please
don't expect it to continue at this high level as we discussed before um again their take rate they continue to say
that we're going to keep driving our take rate lower and lower which is good to see and this is where I wanted to point
out in terms of the guidance now wherever this company goes interest rates will follow in with the whole
history of interest rates that we have from uh the you know 10-year US Treasury
we using that as a basemark as the benchmarks sorry uh we can see that historically interest rates have gone up
and lower we're used to a history whereby we were living at 0% interest rates somewhere here in 2020 following
covid but things have been ticking up and we're like feeling the pinch of course inflation hits hard however is
this completely out of the norm compared to the history to 1965 no if you could
say if you were to draw a line about where the mean is or where the median is sorry you'll be seeing it's probably
somewhere around 5% so are we that off a level whereby interest rates could stay
here for much longer I mean it might be the case or it could TI down because you know if you're to watch this like a hawk
and say oh it's going to go all I would say is that just have broad a let's say you know goal poster where you think
interest rates will go do we see going down to zero again no unlikely so the key thing about them going down to zero
or at least trending downwards is that you'll see here that over the last 20 years what were the best assets to hold
I just thought about this and I'm like okay well what one of the best assets to hold for the last 20 years let's say to
2005 what RS because you know these are highly levered you know instruments to
go out and buy these you know real estate um transactions and you know fund them and they require lower interest
rates to be profitable with higher interest rates that has reversed the equation has been now actually any kind
of company that makes money out of interest is actually going to be doing well so do we foresee higher interest
rates for longer I do believe so that's going to be the case maybe an uptrend potentially from where we started and
therefore as such will Banks and fex make more money based on that interest rate yes that could be the case as well
so that's just something to frame things in terms of what we see the Tailwinds could be for this company so I've


carried out the valuation in three different types one of them was the free cash flow to equity DCF the other one was the free cash flow uh to the firm
DCF the difference really is between these two one of them is more used whenever you value a bank the other
one's more for just a reg company that generates free cash flow but given this is a fintech it kind of falls in the
middle however I've done the adjustments for each one to show what this business is worth and I've used the 20% Revenue
growth rate uh for the DCF or in terms of the uh DCF for the for the free cash
load Equity I've used a 20% growth rate in the net income and the ranges I've
given here are based on the on the higher end it's with the 20% growth rate
but we're starting off with the current numbers that they are giving us however I did normalize these numbers for the
lower range so that you're getting a complete spectrum of what the situation could be like if it was a normalized you
know for that high peak in terms of interest rates causing higher revenues total income as well so you can see for
both of them they're fairly similar um in terms of the highend they're both within the 13B and then on the low end
8B 8 60 for the fre cash fled Equity with a 10 40 for the free cash fled firm
so that suggests that we're pretty close to fair value for this business and the last thing is a total shareholder return
I've been a bit more conservative there but I adjusted a few of the ranges saying the worst case scenario you're going to be earning a r to return at 6%
uh and it could go high as high as 13% and I'm generally fairly conservative with my numbers so I would say this
business at this stage is really fairly well you know offers a good opportunity for us to get good
returns so that's it for this video now if you did enjoy the content I would definitely appreciate a like and a
subscribe as it does help with the algorithm as this channel is still growing if you did find the content useful do leave me a comment letting me
know which parts were most intriguing and if there's anything else I could improve upon all right but hopefully
I'll keep this going and I'll put out some more videos of more companies that I find interesting so I'll see you in the next video take care

ladies and gents welcome back to another Engineers podcast today we have Mahir
who's a principal engineer at WISE Formerly Known As transferwise and we're going to be
talking about some really cool things today maybe you've seen on the pods in
previous times we're a fintech lover but same but different let's say the
building Cloud native applications and there's a really interesting project that Mahir and wiser Keen to talk about
moving on-prem services to a cloud native environment we're going to be
talking around regulations and some of the challenges around payments and moving money around and also hiring
software engineering that's a really hot topic that I'm seeing being brought to
the table on the podcast at the moment and we're heavily involved in here at
Engineers artifacts and myself and the team thanks for coming to join us
for having me pleasure do you want to give us an intro into who my here is and
your background cool uh so I'm here I'm a principal
engineer boys and uh I've been with Vice for four years I joined as a senior
engineer here first and uh advice as a principal engineer look at the tech on
uh why is this debit card product vertical and why is this uh why is his API for businesses product vertical and
yep do you want to give a better intro into
wise than I already have done is in it's way more sophisticated and complex than
moving money around so do you want to give us your elevator pitch into who
wise are cool so yeah so let's go back to the origins of
wise where wise was founded by a founder starbit and Crystal and they had a not
so unique problem of where both of them were working in London but David was being paid in euros and Christo had a
mortgage to pay back home in Estonia in yormos while Krista was earning in pounds and they found out that just
using Banks or any other money transfer service was quite expensive because they wouldn't use the mid market exchange
rate or the exchange rate when you Google something that how much is pound to euro and their fees would be obscene
as well so they just figured that what they would do is that Christopher would just give uh bounce to Talbot for living
in London and David would give him Euros at mid-market rate to pay his mortgage back home in Estonia and they realized
that okay this is a problem just between the two of them but it's not a unique problem it's shared by millions of us
around the world and uh that's how that was that's how it essentially why started and so why this
is a Global Financial technology company and we are presenting a lot of regions
around the world and move money and manage money across multiple currencies around the world we have more than 16
million customers at the moment and more than 60 Banks who use wiser services to
offer to their own customers and like over the last decade we have just worked upon building local Integrations with
local scheme across the globe to make money movement very quick easy and wagy and using the mid market rate
or story from from two people to challenges around paying mortgages
exchange rates to 16 million customers and over 60 Banks that's phenomenal
yeah definitely it was a story what if your last four years been like
with wise uh so there have been few of the years
that have learned and grown as a person as a profession professional the most because of the sheer amount of autonomy
wise gives you and the freedom it gives you to Define your own role or figure
out your own place in the company and doing what's most impactful to achieve
wise's Mission which is essentially make money movement quite easy and free eventually free
and um when I started off with wise I joined um
the debit card issuance product vertical and at that point of time over a few
months we were like at only three or four people so the journey started off with
essentially uh hiring and increasing the size of the team first and at the same
point of time growing the product launching it in more different regions uh we had a massive monolith which was a
massive blocker for a lot of operations so splitting that monolith into multiple services and when I joined we were in
middle of our process of moving from on-premise to like a physical data center to using Cloud features AWS so
supporting that part of the process of moving debit card related aspects to AWS
and then um a massive project of building our own
debit card issuance platform rather than using third-party partners talk to me about that journey of moving
your services from on-premise environments physical data centers to
AWS I know there are specific challenges in payments that it presents which we'll
talk about but talk to me about that journey of moving those services in that
infrastructure already to AWS so as over I'll talk more about wise in
general and what the problems we are facing with on-premise so at that point in time Vice as a business we had to
handle a constantly growing demand of our offerings and we needed to extend
our offerings to multiple regions as well and at the same point of time we need to keep our customers money safe we
need to I trade on the product quickly keep adding more future features time to time and we want the service to be
functional reliable most of the time yeah and um and all of this can be achieved with
physical data centers or very degree degree of ownership of bare metal but at the at that time our goals was
not to faff about trying to get a hold of our account manager of a vendor to fix a particular network card uh running
a model it's database or uh handle a Monday morning load without actually
going down and try a name for a 395 SLR and not having to travel to a different
country where the data center was to perform various key ceremonies required for payments or taking Auditors with us
for them to verify whether a data center is up to the requirement or not and uh supporting the product teams by
making it easier for them to launch new services and database really quickly yeah so that they can continue their
effort of modernizing the model that we have into smaller services and making
deployments and roll back easier and also shortening the time to launch new regions uh and integrating with the
local Regional schemes which without having the complexity of finding a new
data center vendor in those regions now all of this is completely doable with the data center but if at that point of
time with a 20 person infrastructure team and six people in the security team it just seemed close to Impossible which
triggered a move to AWS essentially yeah yeah I can imagine there's quite a lot in there that I I even didn't realize
that you have to consider I understand especially for product teams you know
speed of deploying some of their services or new features but actually being physically present in some of
those locations to perform tasks even I didn't realize that
yeah there it would be multiple resistor data centers where uh you would have a Hardware security module in which you
have to go one by one with an operator and manually enter the keys then they come
out and you need an observer on the side who observes the process in an unbiased manner that nobody's leaking the key
material Etc and also the Auditors verify the data center security and the processes yeah
were you involved in that that planning strategy about moving some of those services or all of your services to the
clouds yeah so I was involved in moving uh our key debit card processing
services from Cloud to AWS talk to us about some of those
challenges and what you learned from that so there are two
specs there are two uh iterations to it so the first iteration is that uh the
initial draw for the debit card product was just three services and we would use
third-party Partners to do everything for us so that's the first layer of it and the second layer of it is when we
build it in-house model raised at ourselves and when we built it properly completely over the cloud itself so the
first step was that it was very dependent on the partner because we would have VPN downloads with the partner and the on-prem uh the partners
in this space and financial services space uh it's a very safe presumption to
have that if you just assume that everybody assumes every is everyone has got significant control over physical
Hardware themselves yeah so any Integrations or any connectivity which
is built by in any existing player in the financial services assumes that you're a
functioning of a data center so there a lot of the effort was just working with
a third party provider in this scenario we call them a card processor to them to
figure out okay how do you want us to connect if we are on AWS uh so this is how we do it right now you
want us to host this device we run it in a Data Center and we form this connection but now we are in AWS how do
we connect persistent reliable connection over Cloud where the
resources are mostly ephemeral and they can just vanish and come back at any time so how do we restructure this
particular part to work with you so that was a six month long effort
because it involved a lot of back and forth with the with a partner and the processor to figure it out
and um the later effort of building our own
like getting rid of our debit card processing Partners was a much bigger
effort and much more because it had never been done before like nobody uh vice versa first and his uh who was the
first who to run a debit card issuance processor completely on cloud because it wasn't even possible before
that talk to me about what that looked like because when there's no support
Community to support you on any of those challenges that's a lot of unknowns you've got to
navigate through so talk to us about that Journey so registration MasterCard debit cards
all around the regions and across different regions we would have different partners where uh whom we
would integrate and connect to help us issue cards now Kardashians come contains of three massive components one
is actual issues of the cards which means the card you the credit or debit card you have the card number on it the
CVV on the back of it two cbvs one on the max type one on the chip itself and the pin you set with it so all of that
is cardholder data and actually issuance of that card holder data the second is saying yes or no when you tap your card
like what happens when you type a card at retail and say yes or no to that either third is all back office
operations which is actually finalizing the money movement settling the bill with the scheme itself and uh also
reconciling that what you paid out and what you got so when we used to use third-party
Partners connecting directly to the scheme was done by the partner handling all sensitive information
like card number CV would be done by the partner because that requires a PCI DSS certification which is a card industry
specific security standard you have to follow if you were to process any card holder data
data and uh connecting with the card manufacturers like somebody who prints the cards and sends it back to
so now if we were to build it all ours now all the current processors use physical
data centers and that's how everything is done where the standard the pcid is a standard is written keeping in mind that
it somebody who anyone who's going to apply for the certification would probably be using a physical Data Center
yeah uh and manage it themselves and the scheme also has all of their documents
all of the spec everything written from the point of view of with an assumption that they're on their own Hardware they
have they can buy a payment HSM to do these do the cryptographic
operations themselves so a payment HSM is uh something which is responsible for transporting your PIN block like
encrypting your PIN Block in a certain manner it also generates your cpv it
authenticates a requests Etc it's payment specific or graphic operations so nobody knows how it's actually done
because usually you just what you do is you just buy a payment HSN you get a proprietary networking Hardware from the
gods keeps which is Mastercard Visa Amex diners Etc and you put it in a data center which connects to the scheme you
get the request you authenticate it with the payment HSM and you do all the stuff say yes or no later on
so the biggest challenge was okay what do we do with the hardware which we need to get with this from the scheme which
we need to host in our data center which we don't have or any and
um so there uh Visa was an absolute star where we worked with visa to develop uh
one of their product offerings which is now Cloud connect and available to other issues to uh where we figured out a way
where Visa will host the networking Hardware in the data center on our behalf and offer it as a service to
their issuers over ipsec tunnels so that didn't require much of a change
on Visa site because they just run the same Hardware but in their data center but it involved a lot of innovation on
how you could actually securely allow other card issuers to connect to them
and uh that was one massive bit of it there was the other aspect of
payment decisions like how do you like a simple thing like the CVV is not randomly generated which you have in a
card or the pin which you enter at a terminal is encoded and encrypted and transported
over a certain format so how do you decrypt it and decode it to actually verify whether it's your PIN correct you
typed up incorrectly or not and uh the algorithms and the documentation on how
it's done is States back to EDS so it's 80s yes wow
and um we will so first of all the problem was we don't know what we had to do like like payment
ages we spoke to different vendors we spoke to Visa they had to bring people out of retirement to answer our
questions we had we spoke to a few uh
DSS Auditors we spoke to engineering team at monzo uh to figure out what needs to be done
over here and over a period of time we've got to know more and more things and the
biggest challenge still was just you don't know what you don't know but we figure implemented a software
solution using a lot of massive test beds uh of test data which we asked visa
to send us so we can verify whether the CBB we are generating is accurate or not whether we are processing the pin
correctly or not and we use Hershey cops Vault for and plug-in system for that
okay interesting there's a couple of things that are on the tip of my tongue
and I wanted to understand why do you think Visa made that move to to
facilitate that for you because that felt as if it was a really pivotal move
in moving some of your services to the clouds so why do you think Visa made that move
for you so reason has actually been a great partner where they're like we're gonna
support you in any way we can and they also understood that it's time for them
to expose this a lot increasingly more and more financial services companies
are going overclock and uh issuing wise we were the first on acquiring wise uh
from an acquiring point of view there are a lot of companies who run over cloud like add in themselves and uh
stripe as well so they realized that book happens sometime or the other
advice because fever also at such a state of where we didn't have any
issuing uh uh software already which worked and we were building something
out of our own so they thought that we would be like the best partner to develop this with test it out with and
go live with yeah and it they had recognized that it's an inevitability that they need to have a cloud offering
it was just about when and they decided that we would be the best partner to
start off this one there's something that's really interesting that's popped up and for me
anyway reflecting on what you've said over the last few minutes engineering through uncertainty
because when you started that project you weren't sure if you could liaise
with monso this is my understanding and interpretation anyway you'd be able to liaise with monzo we didn't know people
from the 80s were going to come out for retirement sorry people from Visa were going to come out for retirement working
on stuff in the 80s so what is it like engineering through uncertainty how do
you do that as a team so as so engineering through uncertainty is
that [Music] first of all believing that if we know what to do we'll be able to do it so
that part is the biggest software people are and there are we have no limitations
for distribute systems Etc so we know that okay once you figure out what to do we can do it so it's figuring out what
to do right or what we are missing right and uh
through engineering through uncertainty is like being very clear with everyone around you that what you don't know or
you know that this functions and drawing hypothesis and then trying and figuring out who you can speak to to validate
your hypothesis or what is required or what you know what you don't know and uh oftentimes the best people to
tell you what you don't know is uh sales people selling the services so
um if you want anything like if you want a database uh or any concepts there
would be sales people who would come and tell you that hey we are selling this database and it does these things you would find out a lot of new things which
you didn't know about uh as a concept you don't have to take them on their word on what it does or anything like
that but as a concept that exists so like for processing we didn't know that we needed a payment HSM till we spoke to
sales people from processing providers that hey we provide you with an HSM so we're like oh we need a SSM they're like
yeah you need an HSN I was like oh what does the HSM do you find out more about that and uh
yeah I think that helped us quite a lot because that's right
that's a really interesting point I think to have the humility to hold your
hands up and say we know where we want to be we think we have an under understanding as to how to
engineer a solution but there's so much in in between that we don't know how do
we navigate that and who do we speak to that sounds as if that's a really important learning from some of this
experience yeah and the other thing is just
testing it like uh just doing what you know uh putting it out there on maybe
various test pads certification Etc which will also enable you to find out what you didn't know what you missed but
doing it quicker makes you makes that Discovery quicker yeah rather than building a big thing which based out of
hypothesis and testing it at a later date yeah I can imagine you're touching on some points around
encryption and cryptography I I can imagine those challenges were quite
significant can we talk about some of those so
uh the older versions of PCI DSS standards was written that it assumed
that everybody would have a Hardware security module which is essentially stores uh secret key material on at a
hardware level itself and with more and more financial Tech
like companies who would renew pcids as move into the cloud HSM becomes sort of
a very difficult thing to have Cloud providers would have some limited HSM offering
but uh there would also be a payment HSM offering on top which Cloud providers do
not have at the moment except right now IBM has something but AWS Google Cloud Azure they don't have a payment HSM
offering so that means that the operations which the adjacents were supposed to do you
have we have to do ourselves with an equivalent level of security which actually secure for the customers
secondly it also clears PC idss certification so what that meant to us that we had to
figure out how to authenticate a card authorization request how to generate a
multiple types of CVV your guard might have how to uh encrypt and encode a pin
and decrypt and decode a pin over Transit and various other verification
features whether you're tapping your card at an authenticated till or not Etc as well
so we uh pcds is over uh newer versions
had started accounting for something called a secure cryptographic device and which could be a software based
thing where this was a very recent uh amendment to that but it has to follow
and hsn's have different levels of security level requirements so uh it's
given by another National information security some company which is not company some
regulatory body which is something like fips 140.2 level 2 level 3 level 2
level two for which there are a lot of solutions uh not a lot of but there are
there is hashico Port which offers that fips 140.2 level 2 compliance
requirements on software itself so we figure that we can use that and write plugins for payment specific
cryptography aspects and uh use that as a Secret store for key storage
the other part is uh we had to invent key import ceremonies like key exchange
ceremonies where the partners would send us keys to store like Visa would send
these keys to store to generate CVV you have to send a key to the card manufacturer to decrypt the data you
sent to and we had to do this during lockdown because when you can't meet in person so
we had to figure out how we're going to design a key exchange ceremonies because these things were never done you just
hsms come with a fixed way of how you do key exchanges or key Imports but if you
have a solution like this you have to figure out how you're going to go it sounds as if with encryption
cryptography especially in payments it's pretty Universal with hsms and keys
themselves were there any independent or isolated challenges that you found
multi-regionally you know in different parts of let's just use Europe as an example were there challenges there that
you were finding that were making it difficult to do this uh
related to card payments is pretty like except for us all of the world is pretty Universal
on how it works with the card schemes except for USCIS is completely different ball game on card payments and uh there
are challenges with local schemes like FPS and sepa which are again very similar challenges but uh they don't
have a solution like the card schemes because card schemes requirement is 140.2 level two compliance which can be
achieved on software based but other payment schemes across countries have
various other requirements on cryptography where they require level three which can which definitely
requires nhsm or if you do a 3DS check when you order online and you need to receive a one OTP any provider in the
car scheme who implements that functionality needs a level 3 compliance as well
foreign visas move then seems like a smart move really because any fintech that I see
Pop Up nowadays you know we we spoke to Griffin a number of years years back and
they're a banking authentication as a service platform we've spoken to adjun
where they were quite clear about they run their payments on an on-premise environment but nowadays everyone seems
to be doing let's just call it holistically payments in the clouds what what would be your biggest learning
that you would give to someone else if they're about to embark on this journey do you feel
uh the first thing will be that um because you're doing something new
uh you really have to read the regulation in or the standard you have
to comply with yourself and break it down to the bare bone and break it down to its intent as well that what are they
exactly trying or why does this requirement exist and
uh what is the way you can solve the intent of this requirement over cloud
because there is a good reason that these requirements exist okay it's not
globally applicable for everything but there would be a reason why these requirements exist and also what their
what was the intention behind them so and trying to implement that intent
onto your system the other part is the auditor whoever audits your system on
whatever you're building is a human person as well to whom you can talk to and to whom you can explain it to it's
better if you get an auditor who already has experience or and understands Cloud systems that is one massive key thing
where fire if you are getting an auditor who's never used to a cloud system you'll have to explain a lot of new
things and concept s when kubernetes you'll have to explain service meshes how do you do service to
service communication authentication or authorization role-based access controls which Cloud offer or you get an auditor
who already has experience with these things and that is quite an important part and
uh you can explain you what you're trying to do how you're solving a particular requirement of any standard
or spec you're following and uh also we can verify while developing uh the
intent of the standard with your auditor or probably a consultant in that space that's our so rather than building
something uh with your head down and then or getting it audited later
keeping an open channel of communication between an auditor consultant on what you're doing and getting feedback
constantly in a design is going to be much cheaper and quicker and better
that's really good feedback and going back to your first point
I feel this more and more with the podcast I think understanding the business logic and
requirements and using the technology as your Aid or support to supercharge you
is really key really key
help us understand more about wise more about your hiring strategy if we move on
to that that's a big thing for us at Engineers especially at the moment with macroeconomic situation hiring retention
is a really really hot topic so talk to us about hiring at WISE and what that
looks like foreign so I wise we everybody who works has
a lot of autonomy at every level so that goes down to you as a contributor to you
your team to the school or the product vertically you belong to or the bigger
Department you belong to so everybody has a lot of autonomy where
everybody feels empowered enough that they can make a suggestion and it will
be heard paid attention to and if they can make a case well enough for it uh
for it it will be executed as well so what do we because of that autonomy what we do
differently advices we expect all of us software Engineers to play a role of product engineer
and it's the same for our analysts our designers and everybody is a product analyst a product engineer a product
manager or a product designer and uh every quarter the entire team gets
together and they figure out each and every one having a say in it on what
they should build next why they should build next and then uh how they should build it
so apart from analyzing the technical ability of Engineers or technical
experience of Engineers we also look at their product mindset on whether they can reason about uh what uh
regarding a product what they are building and why they are building it or what they should be building or why they
should be building it and can they ask the right questions around that part so we have multiple product managers
interview and a pair up and interviewer engineer as part of their interviewing
Journey with why so and on the technical aspect we so we
realize that and interviewing people will never be perfect and uh there is a
difference there's a gap between uh a person's interviewing performance and their performance at a job
and we try and minimize that Gap as much as possible by doing few things we don't
ask whiteboard lead book lead code type of questions or puzzle programming puzzles we try and figure out how they
code in their most comfortable area and with real world problems
and the other part is we don't limit them that you can't use Google or you
can't ask for help Etc we are very we try and act as a team member with them
trying to attack the same problem and uh they can use Google they can use IDE for
coding they can ask whatever we don't expect you to have unrealistic condition what you won't have at the shop
always be able to Google anything you'll always be able to use an IDE et cetera so we try and recreate that
aspect s that's okay I think
I think the interesting part is measuring the impact
or mesh so measuring from interview into when they start at wise
how do you feel you're able to do that because what you're trying to create is
a real life team scenario setting as in how they would act or
uh cooperate with other Engineers or how they would actually find out something
on Google what's the measurement there in your eyes
so a lot of the performance measurement aspects I'm not aware of advice
altogether because I'm not a manager so I don't
exactly know so I know for sure that somebody advised us actually look at that and is looking at that but I'm not
employed but I think the first part it's really interesting looking at a
product engineering mindset and I see this with businesses that are quite akin to yours where you're building something
for large-scale users I think the product interview is now becoming so so important how can
you understand functional non-functional requirements changes in what you're
building as opposed to how do you just build a static application leave it no
scale challenges this won't change in a year two years understanding that mindset of how people
apply their thinking to something real life that customers use on a day-to-day
basis I would say is a really smart way to go and interview people
yeah 100 and it um uh
it makes a massive difference on how you even write a pure technical solution to
anything as well like uh a sample example will be that suppose if you are implementing a
feature that for every car transaction you do you need to show logos of where
you spend the money and if you spend it at McDonald's you need to show the McDonald's logo now uh technically it's quite simple
like find a logo provider send the name of the transaction and get the logo and
show it on the thing now where it gets where the product mindset kicks in is that if the person building this
realizes that hey Vice doesn't just do car transactions wise also does Target tap it's wise also does money transfers
wise also in uh does peer-to-peer payments so it's not just showing the
logo of that card merchant next to the transaction is showing direct debit to
Vodafone vodafone's logo in that scenario as well and uh sending money to
HSBC then HSBC logo is there as well and I think that's where the new technical
design gets affected because it's directly an impact of your product thinking because as a product you
realize that uh it's these things well wanted in the future as well
yeah absolutely no I completely agree I think it's I do think it's a really critical part of
software engineering in today's day and age on where the industry continues to move more that Engineers do think about
the impacts that what their writing has on customers
I want to wrap up for today in just a massive massive thank you for coming to
spend your time with us sharing some of your secrets on what I know was a really
really complex move to the cloud if you like and how
you navigated through that and some of what you did was pretty cool and pretty interesting and I think the hiring
strategy for you guys and girls is is really unique and I'm Keen to see what you guys and girls continue to do
more of and what you've done so so well what a story from

All right, folks. Welcome to Investing for Beginners podcast. Today we have our friend Brett Schaefer back and today
we're going to talk about Remittly versus Wise, the two remittance giants.
And we thought we would discuss the companies, their strengths, their weaknesses, how they compete, and maybe
some competitors against them and whatnot. So, this is one of Brett's largest positions in his portfolio. I
for full disclosure do not own either of the companies but am intrigued beyond belief because of course I'm a payments
geek. So there we go with that. Brett thanks for coming back to the show again from Chitchat stocks and let's let's
talk about wise and ruin. Yeah let's do it. As a disclosure remittly is a stock that I hold in my
No text
portfolio. wise. I don't, but I like both businesses. And if you look at your favorite uh financial data provider of
choice such as Fiscal AI, which I have loaded up right here, the growth rates of these businesses
from both payment volume adoption, revenue, and now increasing earnings
power should get you excited to research why these businesses are growing so quickly, why they're taking market
share, and you know, whether they could be good stocks to own in your portfolio.
Oh, yeah. That's great. So, who do who are they taking market share from? Let's start with that.
Okay. Well, remittly and wise are a little bit different. So, Wise is
No text
digital only remittances. And for anyone that doesn't know the terminology, remittances just means crossborder
transfers. So, for example, you are someone from the United States and you want to send money to someone in Europe,
in France. Wise easily enables you to do that for a fee. Now remmitly is also a
remittance provider but unlike wise remittly is so from from the sending
person they are digital only. So mainly you know from a smartphone or from your computer but they do digital receiving
or physical receiving which is popular in lower income countries that they target such as Mexico,
India stuff like that where many of the people there still want physical cash payouts from their local banking or
financial services provider. Now who are they taking market share from? With Remmitly, it's much easier to
understand. They are taking market share from the traditional legacy players such as Western Union, Moneygram, and then
there's also some such as PayPal that actually have high fee international transfer services.
And one interesting thing you can do is look at Western Union versus Remittly's
either revenue or payment volume. I don't know if Western Union discloses this. So you can use revenue but their
payment volume from North America or revenue from North America has been converging where Western Union is
declining and remitties is rising. So there's a lot of market share getting taken there. Now Wise is more of a
European player. They're United Kingdom company. It started by I think two Estonian guys. at least one Estonian
that was living in the United Kingdom that was the inspiration for starting the business and they're more say higher
income not necessarily some worker that is living in for example the United
States sending money back to Mexico or India but someone that's living in
another country wants to spend in another country or send money to themselves business partners stuff like
that digitally only um and they're disrupting I think more of the
traditional banking system for international money transfers which are extremely high fee um also services such
as PayPal kind of the legacy digital players and they're trying to reduce fees for customers that's their bread
and butter now remittly focuses more on you know servicing the remittance core
customer like a worker you know technology worker sending money back to Asia or something like that where wise
is going for reducing fees as much as possible for those digitally native customers and trying to get them to
switch from the traditional banking services to wise and there are many more products that they're working on to try
to build each of them financial services ecosystems for international payments
No text
but I think that's where we should start and why these companies have grown in
the last decade. Yeah, they and they've grown quite quickly. It's been pretty amazing to see
the the the growth for for both businesses. I guess a question that I have about both of them is
Wise is definitely going after the banking segment. For somebody who worked in the banking industry, I know wires,
wire transfers very intimately. I became the wire guy at the branch that I worked at because I was lucky enough to
successfully complete a lot of them. And so I got the joy of having to hey you got to do a wire go talk to Dave and
they were lots of fun but they are slow and very very expensive and so Wise has
definitely gone after that segment. I'm curious how remittly has gone after more
of the physical. You mentioned that like the actual taking of money is that something they are kind of focusing on.
So and you mean like dispersements in Yeah. Yeah. So like perfect example is you
know a worker here sends money to India and so the person in India can
physically take out the cash where wise they don't do that where where but with remitty they can do that.
Yes. Exactly. So remitti is targeting those customers. They market specifically in the United States on
billboards and areas where these communities are, you know, are congregated and they try to get say
technology workers, agricultural workers, construction workers that want to send money back to these home
countries and they essentially want to replicate the payout network that Western Union
has through banking partners in all of these countries. I don't have the stats in front of me, but I think they have
hundreds of thousands of payout partners. One example they like to give is that even in a place like the
Dominican Republic where I think maybe for safety issues, I'm not sure exactly why they have this in that country, but
there's home delivery for remittances. Maybe I'm not sure why it's there, but Remittly was, you know, smart enough or
wanted to invest to replicate that part product from competitors to offer that to the receiving customer. So, they
essentially want to replicate what Western Union has. they're going to have lower fees than them and that's going to
convince the sender from say the United States, Canada or what have you. Could be any country sending, you know, it
could be reverse. It could be someone sending from Brazil to the United States, something like that. They want
to replicate that with lower fees to convince people to switch. Now, they're not going to have on the whole as low of
fees as Wise because Wise doesn't have to deal with physical payouts and that's always going to come with higher costs.
But Remittley is going to have better fees, really easy to use mobile app, and that's why they've been stealing market
share from the likes of Western Union, and I think probably can for at least the next 5 to 10 years.
Yeah. So, for sure. I'm curious how remitly tech works in that how does the
money how does the money exchange hands? So, if I send money to you in Brazil,
how does that process work? I I I can explain it for for Wise, but I'm not sure how it works with with remitty.
Well, why don't you explain it for Wise? And I can maybe just say before you do
that, that remitt I believe and you know they don't fully disclose this to
investors. It's kind of trying to read through the teles a little bit. I think they are trying to replicate what Wise
does, but they're not entirely there today. That's one advantage Wise has is from the digital infrastructure and
payout perspective. they are at least today superior than Rentley and Remley's trying to catch up to them with that.
Okay. All right. So from all my research and trying to and I've had AI kind of
dumb it down for me a little bit so I could kind of understand it. So the easiest way that I can explain it is
let's say that I'm sending money to Brett and Brett is in Brazil. I would the money would be and I'm doing it over
the Wise platform. What would happen is Wise would take a
$100 out of my Wise account. Whatever I I have connected, if I have a bank account or if I have a card with Wise,
they would take $100 out of my account. They would put it in their local bank here in the United States. in Brazil,
they would send an electronic message to a a regional bank wherever Brett was
located that he would be banking at and they would send they would basically
send a message saying take $100 worth of Hey out of Brett's, you know, out of
this account and deposit it into Brett's account. This all happens very quickly
in seconds. In some cases, 5 to 10 seconds. It can be very, very fast. So the money doesn't actually cross the
border between the United States and Brazil until a later date. So the way the way the system works is it takes the
money from me and it takes the money from and puts it in their account here. It takes the money from an account in
Brazil and gives it to Brett. So the money doesn't actually exchange hands at this point. later on either through the
Swift system or other systems they will they will do a ledger balance where they will do a bulk amount of money from the
United States to Brazil and then withdraw money from Brazil and send it here to the United States so that
everything would balance and so that's that's how they choose to send money
throughout the world and that's how they do it. Now, the difference is again it goes directly to the account. So,
there's not actual cash that is sent to Brent, but he has the $100 in hey ice in
his account that he can use however he wishes to pay for it. Yep. That if I believe and again it's
hard to get the nitty-gritty and all this payments infrastructure. I'm not sure an investor needs to understand
every little thing that goes on, but essentially I think that is what they're doing. And when it's digital, it's much
much easier to do that. And over time, you know, I think part of the maybe concern some investors have with
Remittly is that over time, you would expect payouts to go fully digital. But
from what they're doing and working on, it seems like they understand this. I would believe that they the management
team, the founder, all the employees really understand that and they are working to replicate a lot of Wise's
products to try to become more like them in the future. And these products are,
you know, much much earlier. Wise has a lot more experience in them with them. But that's one way they're going to try
to do that. And if you remember the famous quote where Netflix has to become
more like HBO before HBO tries to become more like Netflix. I think that
originally it was you know Wise wanted to become more like the banks and Remittly wanted to become more like
Western Union at least from a services perspective but with lower fees. Now, Remittly and Wise are going to be trying
to do the same thing with each other where I think Wise is going to be trying to maybe be a little bit more like
Remittly, but Remittly is definitely going to try to replicate some of these things that Wise has. And when you talk
about funding, we're going to mention stable coins, but on the recent conference call, Remittly talked about how when, let's see, I have it pulled up
here. So when they put say integrating USDC stable coins on their balance
sheet, it can really help fund again the liquidity you talked about in global markets. You can have as they say here
near and this is a quote near instant settlement across time zones and weekends which will enable quicker
transaction processing, greater reliability and lower cost when customers send money with us. So as Dave
talked about, they don't necessarily send money every time. You just need to have funding sources in every country
related to what the trends are on. You know, there's on average this amount of money sent in this direction, you know,
from Mexico to Canada or to the United States, United States to Mexico over these hours, over these weeks, and we
just need to have funding there that will reduce our costs and help us charge lower fees to customers while still
generating a profit. Exactly. So, let's talk about the
growth. Like what what kinds of growth are we seeing from these businesses? I'll pull it up right now. If we look at
Remittley's revenue, which should track pretty much with payment volume growth,
and it actually grows slower because they're trying to bring down their take rates over time. They have grown from in
2019 $127 million in revenue to about 1 point just a tad under $1.5 billion over
the last 12 months. So they've gained a tremendous amount of market share. Now gross profit has grown even faster
because their costs have come down as they've tried to replicate some of Wise's funding there. So that's grown
from 70 million to just under a billion dollars. And if we look at Wise, it's been a similar story. I'll pull up the
numbers in front of me right now. So, they well, yeah, if we look at their total revenue, they go back a little bit
farther, I think, because they went public earlier. In 2016, they only did
28 million or actually, sorry, that's pounds, 28 million pounds of revenue.
And over the last 12 months, which I guess ends March 2025, is their latest update. 1.6 billion pounds. So they're
similarsized revenue businesses today. I think they both have and they target slightly different markets. You know,
this is a ven diagram of overlapping customers. They definitely have specific customers that they target that the
other one doesn't. But they have if you're you're going to talk the entire
money transfer business uh across borders, whether individuals, businesses, whatever. They both have
similar levels of market share. And from what you can from what they share and
their estimates, it's about 3% maybe pushing 4% now given their recent growth
each. So combined they're still under 10% and that should give them a lot of runway to grow going
forward. Yeah, for sure. For sure. So I was reading Morning Star's report about Wise
yesterday and I'm curious what your thoughts are on Remittly. Their take was
that at this point they didn't really feel like Wise really had a moat or much
of a moat. What what do you think about remittly in that regard?
I think in the classical sense maybe the morning star definition sense you would
argue today they don't have like a wide moat but I see ways that you
could have an emerging moat. for example, you know, you're not going to have, I guess, the branding maybe
matters um a little bit because you do have to trust your international remittance provider. You're going to send $1,000 back home. You need to
definitely trust who you're dealing with. But I I kind of disagree because
one I think with remittances there is the ability to build up a network effect
where you have to get and this is underappreciated because there's 200 countries around the world or give or
take 200 countries and it's not that you have to get enabled to send in 200
countries. You have to have the ability to send from one country to 199 and then the second country to 199 and that can
that is many many more corridors as they say than you would think and it takes tons of years to build up get the
regulatory licenses all of that. So I think there's a network effect in that regard. There's also maybe even more
with remitty than wise because they're digital only. The payout infrastructure is something you can't replicate
overnight. But with Wise and Remittly in general, I do think there are economies
of scale. As you get larger, you have a bigger balance sheet which can help cheap more cheaply fund uh payouts and
what have you all the services you're providing at a lower cost. That allows
you to have lower fees than the competition, which convinces customers to stay. And then the cycle repeats over
where more customers are staying, you get larger, you reduce your cost, you add more services. I I I kind of think
there are emerging modes here. And maybe more importantly today though, is the
counterpositioning versus the existing banks. Western Union cannot, this is maybe
speaking more with remitty, Western Union is not going to be able to get rid of their physical branches overnight.
They definitely have technology debt. They can't replicate what remittly has
unless they try to totally disrupt their entire business. And that's just a classic innovator's dilemma. Now with
Wise, you have the banks that charge what maybe $50 flat fee for a wire
transfer, give you a bad rate. That is another level of innovators dilemma that I think Wise has taken
advantage of for years and years and years. So if they don't have a wide moat according to Morning Star, I think that's okay because the historical
say situation within the remittance business that has allowed both of these companies to gain market share. I see no
signs of that stopping over the next 5 or 10 years which should help them keep growing uh payment volume, revenue, and
hopefully profits. Yeah, I would I would agree with that. Yeah, I I think that's a I think that's
a really smart way to look at it. I I didn't agree with the Morning Star report. I thought it was a little
narrow-minded and so I agree with what you're saying. I I'd like to talk a little bit about the cost aspect of what
No text
what both companies are really trying to do. And maybe you could talk about kind of the cost or the take rate versus the
volume and how that's really playing into to both companies success in the future now and in the future.
Well, when you look at both companies conference calls or investor
presentations and this is why specifically they discuss their take rate and maybe bring it up in the
segment and KPIs on Yeah. Okay. Great. They have it on fiscal AI. Um they have
they have the take rate from the company. Yeah. Let me just do quarterly.
So when they're talking with investors, when
they're talking about bragging about their products, what have you, they always are trying to say that we're
reducing our cost and then we're going to pass on these fees to customers. And I think as they keep lowering their
cost, they are going to widen their competitive
position versus any sort of now this is not necessarily because they already have they already have a better value
proposition versus the banks. This is maybe more versus say another digital digitally native remittance provider
someone that is trying to copywise that can give them an advantage versus
that company. And then Remittly is similar. They say they want to provide the best fee for their services and that
has come down over time and one way you can track it is if payment volume is growing slower than revenue. So if we
look at we'll go to wise first total crossber revenue has grown at oh wait
yeah total crossber revenue has grown at a 13% year-over-year rate since June of
2022. And if we look at total, let's see, total volume, it's grown at a
27% rate. So, they are reducing their fees a lot and they're making more
money. And this is a little bit different than Reitly. This is part of the stuff that remitt
um copy, I would say, over the next 5 to 10 years. Wise has a lot more services that they can make money on such as the
business bank accounts with the high yield savings, the why can't I think of the name, the debit
card. They're launching card services, spending services. So, not only sending money to someone else, they want to
allow you to store and spend money. So, that's kind of the threelegged pillar
and or three-legged stool. And that is another way for them to make money while
reducing the fees but also you know having revenue earning potential from these customers. And if we look at I
don't think I need to pull up the numbers directly here but remittley's uh send volume has grown consistently
faster than their revenue which means that their take rate is going down and down and down. That means their fees to
their customers keep going down and down and down but at the same time their gross margins are expanding. So that
shows that at greater scale they're able to either a negotiate better rates with regulators, clean up their transfer
processes, you know, just get more efficient and efficient every quarter with their payment infrastructure, and
that I think that should only continue. Yeah, I I I 100% agree with with your
analysis there. I think one of the things that makes both of these companies stand out, it reminds me a
little bit of Ajin, the payments company from the Netherlands, where they are constantly trying to lower their costs,
which they think will attract more and more customers and bigger customers. And
as they can get a bigger volume, they can reduce their rates even more, but remain profitable and grow the profits
because they can they can use that operating leverage that they generate to make more and more profits and it
becomes a nice little flywheel for them. And so that's one of the things that attracted me about wise and I wasn't
aware that remitt was doing the exact same thing. So that to me is very very
attractive. Yeah. And with remitti, I don't think they have the exact same infrastructure
as wise today, but again, and this is some of the bare case that I've read before, they are trying to replicate
some of what what wise has done for digitally first sending. And I also think the aden um comparison works for
the innovators dilemma and technological or just basically product expertise
where remittly wise they started from scratch. They built a better product for mobile smartphones, easier to
understand. And compared to the legacy players, it's so much easier. For example, if like
this happened in my personal life, my friend was trying to convert money to yen for a trip to Japan
and through his legacy, I always say legacy, but just one of the big banks in the United States, it was going to be a
complicated service. You probably had to call the customer support rep. He couldn't really find what to do on the mobile application. It it was going to
cost $50 flat, which was going to be a huge fee for the amount of money that he wanted on the trip. But if you open
Wise, you can fund it very easily. You know, it's takes a little bit of time because you have to go through their
security protocols. You know, they're trying to reduce fraud and stuff like that. But you can easily see on the
mobile application what your rate is, what currency conversion level they're using, you know, from say that one
currency to the other. and you can see upfront what the fee is going to be and
it's generally going to be the cheapest out there. So that's something that the banks either don't want to or can't
replicate because of their old solutions and
I just think that gives Wise a huge advantage o over that. Yeah, that's true. Very true. So
we've been we've been I think fairly bullish on the businesses so far. if you had to if you had to cover what could go
No text
wrong like where where could these where could investments in these companies go bad
first with wise I think there are some neo banks that could potentially replicate some of their services for
example you have and I know they don't play in the same exact markets but I think they actually partner with each
other as new bank um there's you know people talk about
how there's going to I don't know those ones, Revolute or SoFi or what have you that really offer
great mobile applications, good products for customers, and
they can have so much more of like the core personal finance app for an
individual that if they added these international transfer services, maybe they would be able to take, you know,
market share back from Wise because if someone can, they're just going to use one mobile application versus another.
But I think one way Wise is trying to counterposition for this or prepare for this is and I forget what it's called.
It might be called the Wise platform. They changed their name a lot where they
are actually the ones powering the international money transfers for a company like New Bank or a company like
Revolute and that allows them to one earn money from that get greater scale
and make a friend out of a potential enemy. So I think they're doing quite
well for that. Uh for remitly it's a little bit different and I guess one of these is also possibly applies to wise.
No text
There's one a stable coin uh fear which I maybe we can talk about a specific section but with remittly and this is
why I think the stock has fallen this year is there's remittance outflows worries from the immigration crackdown
in the United States and kind of the anti-globalization narrative around the world that hasn't shown up in their numbers yet but I think that is the
biggest fear for remitti and then maybe comparing the two one thing I see from
investors that kind of get fearful about Remittly and like Wise much more is that
remittly has higher fees on average than Wise. But I think when you understand
that Remittly has the physical payouts, you see that that that's not really an
applesto apples comparison. So there are some things to worry about, but on the
whole, I think both companies are dealing with them fine. And that the fact that they're gaining market share can help with any macroeconomic
headwinds. And as we maybe discuss in a later section on this podcast, the
stable coin initiative actually might or sorry, not initiative, the potential
growth in stable coins, which I I don't know what the numbers are yet, but there's a whole narrative in the investing world about stable coin
disruption for all sorts of payments. If that occurs, actually think it can help remittly and wise and not hurt them.
I would agree. All right. So, one other thing I guess I would throw out there about Wise. It's this is I think more
specific to them is one of their I guess revenue streams is the money that you
mentioned that they hold in people's accounts. They they you know they charge interest rates, you know. So they
because the rates here in the United States are normalized at the moment and are higher than they've been over the
last few years, they're generating a little more income from that than they normally would. And so there are
concerns that if you know the rates do fall that that could impact some of the
growth of of the business. But at this point it's not a it's not a huge amount
of revenue for the business. But as the company continues to push their cards
and the bank part of the bank, it's not a bank, but the savings part of Wise as
those deposits grow in theory, so should the interest rate that they earn on those savings accounts. And that could
be a potential headwind if rates ever do change. So that's something definitely
to keep an eye on as you as you look at a company like Wise over the years. It's something I wouldn't say it's like a
death nail, but it's definitely something that could impact some of the growth of the business,
right? Yeah. Because that's gone from close to zero to over 500 million pounds
in the last 12 months. So, it's been a huge profit driver for them. They do break it out on their earnings that they
kind of separate what the core profitability is and then they add back then interest income. I think that's,
you know, on the one hand, yes, people are worried about interest rates being lowered. I I'm not sure if they will. I
I think that's extremely hard to predict, if not impossible. But in general, the fact that they can
invest the quote unquote float or what they hold on the balance sheet is a long-term advantage and an attractive
part of the business model. Yeah, for sure. For sure. All right, so we've teased a whole bunch about the
No text
stable coin thing. Let's let's talk about that. How how is this how could this potentially impact both companies?
is a good thing, bad thing. What are your what are your thoughts? Well, let's start with the narrative
No text
around stable coins and maybe we'll describe what they are first. So, stable coins are a cryptocurrency that's tied
to the value of fiat currency. So if you have one USDC, which is the one from
Circle, it is, you know, if you have put $1 in, you get $1 worth of USDC and it
should track the value of the US dollar. So at least compared to other currencies
and stuff like that. So if you deposit it and get you have one USDC,
3 months later, you should be able to uh withdraw $1 US. Now the narrative around
payments and this applies to not just wise remittly Western Union and the
international money transfer business but it also has been applied from a narrative perspective to payment
processors Visa and Mastercard anyone within the payments ecosystem. There is
a thought that stable coins are going to eliminate fees for money transfers. It's
going to be either free or extremely low cost and that is going to kill these
businesses, right? Because wise and remittly their bread and butter is earning a small take in international money transfers and if that goes away
your revenue goes away and you're in big big trouble.
No text
What I think the narrative misses though is that stable coins can exist.
But you have to think about what they call on-ramp and off-ramp. And to
illustrate, maybe we can go through an example of why someone is using remittlier wise to send money to another
country. So you have say US dollars and then you're trying to get to your family
member in Mexico to have Mexican pesos that they can spend on their daily
goods, save up, maybe they have an healthcare expense, something that you're sending money back for. Whatever
the reason is, you have to start with US dollars in the United States and you
want to get to Mexican pesos in Mexico. Now, it doesn't matter if you are
funding your remittley account or funding the money transfer with US
dollars or USDC. But eventually once you get to that point in the transfer cycle, you have to
because let's say the local Takaria or grocery
store or Walmex, they don't accept USDC as a form of payment. you have to convert to pesos in
the local bank account. Now, that's where the fees come in and that's where
the costs come in and it's not going to be free. So, even if stable coins are used, it's not going to eliminate these
fees that people have to pay or excuse me that remitt has to pay and then passes on to their customers.
And it actually will be I I believe an advantage over the Western unions of the world because stable coins can be used
as we talked about earlier to manage their balance sheet better for off-hour transfers. And if you want to fund your
account, they've already announced that. I think it's not out today, but maybe it's coming out in a month. They were discussing it on the conference call
that that was a couple weeks ago. they are already allowing people to use
USDC as a funding source and as a way to pay out. But again, the fees aren't
going to go away because eventually people want to spend in the country or the currency that you can actually use
for spending what you want to use with your your money uh in these home markets.
Yeah. And I think the other thing about the whole on-ramp off-ramp part of it,
and you mentioned this, we were talking off air about this, is that it feels like everybody feels everybody's talking
about the potential disruption, but they're not talking about that very important piece of the on-ramp off-ramp
part of it, which in a lot of places, they don't have the technology yet to
off-ramp something. So let's say it's coming from the United States and we have better technology and it's going to some very very small town in the middle
of nowhere Brazil. They very most likely will not have the technology or the
ability to convert that USDC into a local currency the hey ICE or whatever
you know if they're in a bord of you know Uruguay then they may have you know a different issue changing that currency
and so that could present a problem. And the other part of it too is the whole goal of wise and it appears remittly is
to lower the costs to attract more people. And so if something like stable coins helps lower the cost of making the
transfers, I'm not talking about the actual conversion to currency, but the actual transfer itself. I think they're
going to be all for it. Visa and Mastercard are embracing this wholeheartedly because if it makes things cheaper, it makes business better
for them and they're all for it. So, I think it feels like the off-ramp part of it is something that I don't think it's
talked about quite enough yet and the technology doesn't feel like it's quite there yet because to your point, not
every place will accept USDC. I would I would be hardressed here in the United States to figure out where I could use
USDC to pay for something. I'm sure it's possible, but you know, in my ignorance, I don't know. So, I I think there's a
lot of fears about what could potentially happen as opposed to what will happen.
Oh, exactly. Exactly. And when you look at the stable coins, you
have to they not only need to be accepted to just be used quote unquote
of, oh, I can convert to a stable coin. Yes, sure. Now, you can buy a bunch of cryptocurrencies with that, but with
these businesses, they're trying to operate in the physical world, buying goods around the the globe. And
you're not going to replicate the acceptance of Visa or Mastercard overnight. And if you can't or you know,
you need to get to physical currency, there's still going to be fees. No one is going, no one in this entire value
chain, whether it's for Mitly, Wise, the local banks, Visa, Mastercard, what have
you, they are not going to do anything for
free or else they're just not going to perform the service. So regardless of it's stable coins USD or USDC
I think the more digital transfers grow the more it benefits remittly and wise
and I I really see no way for stable coins in their current existence to
totally disrupt these businesses within within a decade. Yeah, I think that's it.
Yeah. No, I I would I would agree with that. I think the other thing that's not discussed too is
the current system that we have allows for any ambiguities that may happen in the
payment. So I'll give you an example. Years ago when I was working in the bank, we did a wire transfer to Japan.
Trans, you know, keep in mind transfers are different anywhere you go and wire transfers are a whole other beast. And
but the point is is that the customer gave us the wrong account information.
So unfortunately the money went to the wrong person's account. Now kind of the
way wire transfers work is you know you track it from you know your bank to an international bank to a transfer bank to
the local bank in Japan for example but you still have visibility in the
transfer. You see where the money goes. You see who sent it. You see who touched it, if you will, and where it landed.
And so because of that, you have the ability to recall the transfer. You can
you can ask for the money back, and you in most cases, you can get the money back. With the way that crypto and and
stable coins are set up, you don't have that ability. And so if a payment goes through or a transfer goes through and
there's something wonky about it, let's say you have, you know, you you put a two instead of a one for the last digit
on the account. If it goes to wrong account number, there's not a lot of ability to track that money and to get it back. And there's no way to dispute
transfers or or payments with with those things as well, at least at this point.
And so there is a certain trust factor that goes into using something like WIS
or remittly because you you have faith Western Union the banks you have faith
when you use those things that when you send it it's going to go where you want it to go and if there is a problem you
have a way of rectifying the problem with some of the things that are going on with stable coins at this point as
we're talking those things are not in place and so there's going to be some
problems unfortunately So there there's going to be mistakes that are going to happen. And until that part of the
process is really worked out, I I'm worried that I I I I fear that the total
acceptance by the community I think will be less than I think what they're hoping for just because of that kind of, you
know, KYC part of the equation. Oh yeah. And part of the reason the fees
exist is to fund fraudulent transactions that not fund them but basically pay for
stuff that goes wrong or mistakes or essentially things that criminals
stealing stuff. It's the same thing with credit cards and how you know part of the fees get defunded there. I will
mention there is a distinct difference here and I think this is again where Wise has the edge in part of their
business over remittly where when Wise has been asked about stable coins they say and because they've and you talked
about that wire transfer process they've totally eliminated the wire transfer process and that's how their fees are so low. They think and believe right now
that stable coins do not offer them superior costs and therefore they're not going to use them. They said look we
would use them if it reduces our cost but right now we don't see any ways you know they're exploring they want to keep reducing their cost but they don't see
it now remittly has embraced stable coins and maybe that's because they are behind a bit in the payments
infrastructure and one thing I should mention is that remitt and this might
weaken their potential moat versus the competition they use what is called visa
direct as a partner for realtime crossber remittances to say debit cards. Now that
is something that Visa offers and they can not only offer to remmitely but anyone else. So I think Remittly is
trying to build out their own infrastructure over time but Wise again
is probably ahead of the game in this regard and you know it's helpful to have a partner like Visa to onboard
customers. Um, they have stuff. I think this might be a little bit different. Again, it it can get confusing with with
the payments infrastructure, but there's an integration that remitt now has with WhatsApp where you can talk with I think
maybe even the Meta AI, but you can have a conversation with the bot. You can say, "Hey, look, I want to send the
money here. What are your fees going to be? Here's the rate. Here's what it's going to end up in this person's
account." So, you have this partnership and you have all that stuff that can help drive growth. Again, back to the
cost thing. Remittly is using stable coins, I think, because maybe their infrastructure is not as good as Wises,
and that's something to consider for investors. I don't think it makes Remittly a bad business. It's just Wise
from the infrastructure perspective is superior. I'd almost consider them
maybe remitt is the stripe and wise is the aden especially because wise
and adinion are you know European versus stripe and remittly west coast United
States. Yeah. Yeah, that's a that's a I think that's a pretty good analogy. And I
wouldn't I wouldn't consider them a worse business. It's just different and they're using the tools that they have available to to do what they need to do
for their customers. And that's bottom line that's really what matters the most. What what are your thoughts on the
No text
valuation of of remittly and maybe just a overview of of wise?
So the reason I own remitt and not wise is because I think the valuation is
significantly cheaper today. Remillian we just use for the podcast purposes
market cap because you know enterprise value is a little less but we'll keep it simple. So they have 3.0 $.9 billion
market cap over the last 12 months as I mentioned about $ 1.5 billion in
revenue. They are guiding I think for in between and again exact numbers aren't important here but over 20% revenue this
fiscal year. I think they can keep growing revenue at a pretty good clip. It's going to slow down at a larger
number from a percentage basis, but I I see no reason they can't get to $2
billion next year because they're they're going to do about 1.6 billion this year. I think they can get to 2
billion next year and then within a few years $3 billion in revenue. Now their gross profit gross profit margin is over
60%. And if we look at their cost so say their cost of revenue is going to be all
the payment stuff uh that they include you know pay us to visa direct what have you.
Now below that you have R&D for product and then marketing and then general and
overhead. Now they're getting leverage consistently on these costs and general
and overhead should and you know it's a red flag if it doesn't it should get a lot of leverage at scale. If it doesn't
that kind of means the business is probably spending willy-nilly on corporate stuff, offices, company
retreats, you know the Salesforce model. But right now they are spending a lot on product innovation and they're also
spending a lot of money on marketing because they are attracting so many new customers and they're getting a huge
return and a quick return on these customers that they're attracting. So right now their margins are pretty much
close to zero. Their net income margin I think was 1%. Last quarter they generated like $1 million in earnings.
But if you look at the potential leverage as they slow down marketing and you get more scale on your product
development and that 60% gross margin, I think 20% profit margin is pretty doable
at a good enough scale for this company. I think they could get there today if
they wanted to just by maintaining their existing systems and and slowing down
customer acquisition spend from marketing because they do spend a ton of money on marketing which I think is a
good thing. So the way I look at it is okay well if
you have $3 billion in revenue and a 20% profit margin which ar isn't there today
but I think can be there with by 2030 that's $600 million in earnings versus a
market cap below $4 billion today that's a PE ratio close to five maybe it's like
seven that's ve I I think very very cheap for a company growing this
quickly. It has three-year revenue cagger of 38%, 5-year revenue cagger of
58%. Pretty darn good. Now, Wise a little bit different. They are trading at and some
of it can be confusing because we're looking at British pounds, but just think of it, you know, fairly close
transfer to US dollars. They're at market cap of 10 billion pounds. They
do, as I mentioned, 1.6 billion in revenue. So if we think about
their potential earnings power and they are more profitable than Remilli today
but if we think on the whole their unit economics and cost should be similar
they have very similar levels in revenue but one trades at a market cap of 10
billion versus a market cap of 4 billion and wise is a great business. I think investors will do well owning this thing
over the long term. Probably significantly better earlier this year
or in late 2024 when the stock was at six British pounds versus 10 today, but
still a little expensive. Uh but not not too bad.
That's that's pretty good analysis. All right. So is there anything else about either one of these companies you feel
like investors should know that we haven't touched on? So I'll speak on product development I
No text
think as the last one and this is where again wise today has more services for
um you know say wealthier international customers or people that want to spend money, save money or or businesses. For
example, my podcast, we use Wise since we have some international payouts we have to do and the fees are cheap, you
know, cheaper than PayPal and they're pretty easy pretty easy to do.
The problem is they have been a bit stagnant in adding new products. For example, we can't get a spending card
with them. It just hasn't been approved. So, maybe they need more
payout or sorry, they more product spending could be helpful. Maybe they need to reinvest in adding new services
for the platform. Uh but with Remittly, they are and they have to execute first.
They've been kind of hyping it up. They've been making a lot of these new products that are about to launch, I
believe, in September for customers. One, some some they've already launched, but they've reenhanced their platform
for small and micro businesses to try to compete more with Wise there because that is a huge market for sending money.
For example, if you have a developer or some sort of worker in Asia, some other country and you're paying money to, you
know, pay out their salary. They're also adding things such as the remittly wallet, which is going to be similar to
the Y savings account. It's more of the storing money and not just sending money. And they're actually adding some
new services such as, and I like the moniker here, send now, pay later, where
for an extra fee or maybe a little bit of a loan. If you are short on cash and
they, you know, maybe you're getting your paycheck later, but someone that you want to send money to needs the
money now, you can get the money to them much much quicker and you have a
bridging funding of that. So, they're adding all these new services. They're trying to build and expand more from
just sending to all sorts of financial services for individuals and small
businesses. And that's the overlap where over time and I think both players can win. It's a large market. It's not going
to be a winner takes all scenario, but over time Wise and Ritley are going to try to copy each other's products. I
wouldn't be surprised if a remitt debit card shows up, especially with that existing relationship with Visa.
And I think both companies have a lot more potential
to upsell their customers on new services over time. There's, for example, our small my small business. We
want more products from Wise because we use them all the time. And I think there's we're not the only one out
there. There's plenty of other people. Yeah. Yeah. For sure. And what is that saying? Imitation is the highest form of
flattery. Exactly. Everyone wants to copywise and I don't blame them. They have the
cheapest costs. Yep, they do. They do. All right. So, lots of great knowledge. You dropped
again today as always. Where can people find more about what you have going on elsewhere?
All right. Yeah. If you want detailed analysis on remitty in written form, I do have that over at our newsletter
called Chitchat stocks. I also have a podcast called Chitchat stocks that you can find on YouTube, Spotify or Apple
Podcasts. follow it there. We do coverage on companies such as remittly
wise, all sorts of stuff, interviews covering super investors, and we have
two episodes a week. So, if you like this show, I think you'll like it as well. We try to help investors learn and
get better. Yep. It's well well worth your time. It's one of my favorite episodes to listen to every week. They have two
shows and they have lots of great interviews and lots of great discussions about stocks, which there is not a lot
of out there on the podcast world. And they're one of the few that do it. and they do it really well. So, it's definitely definitely worth your time.
Highly, highly recommend it. So, with that, we'll go ahead and sign us off. You guys go out there and invest with a margin of safety emphasis on the safety.
Have a great week and we'll talk to you'all next
