# Transcript 1

Ben:  Welcome to season 14, episode 2 of Acquired, the podcast about great companies and the stories and playbooks behind them. I'm Ben Gilbert.
David: I'm David Rosenthal.
Ben: We are your hosts. Today, we tell the story of a handbag company that won't sell you a handbag, a traditional saddle maker that makes very little of their revenue from saddles, a company that somehow has grown to be worth over 200 billion despite rejecting manufacturing efficiencies and economies of scale, a company so obsessed with craft and a reputation for quality that they have stayed independent while every other luxury brand has merged into conglomerates.
That's right, listeners. Today, we tell the oldest story we have ever told here on Acquired, older than Standard Oil or the New York Times. This company dates back to 1837 in Paris, France. The crown jewel of the luxury industry, Hermès.
David: Ben, do you know what company was also founded in 1837 that we have discussed quite a bit on Acquired?
Ben: No, I do not, David.
David: That would be the other iconic color luxury company, Tiffany.
Ben: Really?
David: Also founded in 1837.
Ben: Chuck T. This episode, listeners, has been probably just under 12 months in the making. LVMH was just after one year ago, and it was in that episode that I feel like I got a real penchant for everything that Hermes stood for. After 187 years, still under family control, they're on their sixth generation of family leadership at the helm. David, everything Hermes does is just so focused, intentional, and pure. As much as they get lumped together with brands owned by LVMH, they are in many ways the anti LVMH.
David: We've got a great discussion of that later in the episode. I used to think that and I no longer think that. But after our LVMH episode, you were so inspired by learning about Hermes. You went out and you bought your first luxury object. It was not an LVMH brand.
Ben: Yes, that is true. My wife and I were on our honeymoon, listeners, after LVMH, so last summer. We were in Aix-en-Provence, and we walked by an Hermès store. I thought that this would be a great time to go in and get each other something as a honeymoon gift. My wife got a little twilly scarf, and I got an Hermès belt. It's the only luxury item I own of any traditional luxury brand.
David: Yeah, as foreshadowed on our holiday special episode a couple months ago.
Ben: Listeners, if you want to know every time an episode drops, you can sign up at acquired.fm/email. You'll get hints at what the next episode will be and follow up facts from previous episodes when we learn new information. Come discuss this episode with us at acquired.fm/slack. Come check out our second show, ACQ2, where we interview founders, investors, and experts, often as follow ups to these episodes.
Ben: With that, this show is not investment advice. David and I may have investments in the companies we discuss, and this show is for informational and entertainment purposes only. David, I feel like we're starting before 1837.
David: Yes, but not too much before 1837.
Ben: All right, we're not going to the Egyptian invention of the handbag or anything like that.
David: Boy, let me tell you, I was tempted. If you read The Luxury Strategy, which is a great book that we've referenced many times on Acquired, they start back 50,000 years ago. We start in 1801, not in Paris, not even in France. As we've been talking about, the land of beauty, luxury, enlightenment, where Hermes, of course, was founded and is still based today.
Uniquely, Hermes still does 85% of their production by hand, by Mastercraft's people in France, as we will talk a lot about. But instead, we start in the land of hardness and precision of engineering, of exactitude, the future land of the Porsches of the world. That is right, Germany.
Ben: A century before the Porsches and Volkswagens of the world.
David: Yes, where Thierry Hermes was born in the town of Krefeld, which is just outside of Dusseldorf, where he's the sixth child of a family of innkeepers.
Ben: Hermes, is that a German name? A French name?
David: Hermes is obviously not a German name, even I know that. Thierry's father was French and his mother was German. Shortly after Thierry is born, he was born in 1801, something pretty major happens in France and then throughout continental Europe that will become very, very important to our story here, and that is that Napoleon comes to power in France. This is the era we're talking about here. Napoleon.
Ben: We finally did it here on Acquired, your AP European history class has now merged with business history We're covering Napoleon.
David: He is critical to what is about to happen here. In the aftermath of the French Revolution, Napoleon essentially stages a coup, declares himself emperor, first of France, and then he basically begins conquering all of continental Europe, including Germany. This Napoleonic conquest was, at the same time, both the very best thing that could happen to young Thierry, It leads directly to Hermes.
Also, the very worst and truly worst, all this conquering, this glory of France that we're going to talk about becomes important to Hermes, that's the result of wars. Thierry's entire family, his parents, his mom, his dad, all five of his siblings, are all killed either directly in the Napoleonic wars or by disease and famine as a result of this. Absolutely terrible. The result is that Thierry, by the time he's 20 years old, he's an orphan. He is the last Hermes left.
Ben: David, 1821, pretty rough time out in the world. Do you know who was born in this year, 1821, and was also an orphan? We have talked about them on Acquired.
David: Obviously not Rockefeller, which is where my mind first went, because we talk a lot about his dad.
Ben: Yup. Louis Vuitton himself.
David: He will also come up here in a minute.
Ben: Twenty years younger than Thierry Hermes, but also an orphan.
David: Wow, I didn't know he was also an orphan.
Ben: Yup.
David: Wow, it's just crazy. Two orphans, one of whom was German, go on to found the two most important, most French, most luxurious brands and really communicators of status in the modern world. That's wild.
Ben: Yeah, especially crazy considering they both came from nothing. These people who would create the monikers of the elite of what would go on to be the symbols of wealth and nobility, came from nothing, were orphans, and at their greatest aspirations were craftspeople for the elite. They were almost servants.
David: Yes. In 1821, Thierry leaves Krefeld, leaves Germany. He abandons his original destiny as an innkeeper. He moves to France, not to Paris, but to Normandy in the north. There, he becomes an apprentice under a master craftsman learning the art of equipage craftsmanship. Equipage is the business of outfitting horse drawn carriages. Who were the customers of horse drawn carriages? Ben, like you're talking about.
Ben: The nobility.
David: The nobility. Horses were extremely important to the world back then. The horse was the car. It was the Ford F150, it was the Toyota Camry. It was also the Rolls Royce that drew the carriage, and only the Rolls Royces were the carriages.
When Thierry moves to Normandy and takes up as an apprentice, he apprentices for 16 years. It's not until 1837 that he finally moves to Paris as now a master craftsman and opens up his own shop in Paris on the Rue Basse-du-Rempart in the 9th arrondissement, which that whole street today no longer exists.There, he establishes himself as really quite an exceptional harness maker for horse drawn carriages.
It's unclear to me at this point if he's using the famous saddle stitch, which becomes so important to Hermes. The reason it's unclear to me is because he's not making saddles. Saddles are what other people are making. It's not that the nobility don't ride horses. They do, but they ride horses like the elite today drive a Ferrari. It's not something they do every day.
Ben: Right. Their daily driver is a Bentley because someone else is driving them. They have a Ferrari for when they occasionally want to drive a Ferrari. They'll climb in a saddle occasionally, but mostly they're in the carriage.
David: Yeah. When Thierry arrives in Paris in 1837, he pretty quickly starts becoming known as really the best harness maker and carriage outfitter in Paris serving the nobility, which is pretty impressive. Here, he's this immigrant from Germany, apprenticed in Normandy. He shows up in Paris. All of a sudden, he's making the best stuff out there.
Ben: It turns out he was just really good at the craft.
David: He had exceptionally good timing. We spoke about Napoleon a little bit earlier. When Thierry finally comes to Paris, at this point, Napoleon I has been defeated in the Battle of Waterloo. That was 1850, and France has now seesawed through a whole bunch of different republics, and the monarchy comes back. It's crazy French history stuff.
Shortly after Thierry returns, Napoleon's nephew, Napoleon III stages another coup and reestablishes the Empire in France. This is super important, Ben, to what you were talking about earlier about this guy's an orphan. Louis Vuitton was an orphan. How did they become so important?
When Napoleon III comes to power in France, he does two things. (1) He completely modernizes the city. If people have heard of the Baron Haussmann who rebuilt Paris, that happens at this time under Napoleon III. They transformed Paris from a medieval city with super tight streets. If you go up to Montmartre, those streets around there, that is old Paris. But when you think of the Eiffel Tower, the museums, the grand boulevards, the Champs-Élysées, that's happening right at this time.
The Baron Haussmann, he's like Robert Moses was in New York in the mid 20th century remaking New York. He is given full latitude and direction by Napoleon III to burn Paris to the ground and remake this city as a modern city.
Ben: Fascinating.
David: This is super important for Thierry and Hermes for two reasons. (1) In the old medieval streets in Paris, not that many people were going up and down them. Not that many people were going to see the nobility in their carriages and all their finery. Now you've got the Champs-Élysées, the Grand Boulevard, everything about the gallantry of Paris that we know today, is all on display now. This becomes really important for showing off for signifying your wealth, your status.
The other related thing here that happens with Napoleon and Napoleon III is that status is no longer just about what you were born into. In the old system, the nobility, the royalty, it was like you're born noble or you're not. It's independent of how much money you have, what you do, or what influence you have. Under Napoleon, he brought in this modern idea that you could shift your class. He was essentially a nobody, and he became the emperor of Europe. That'll completely upset the mindset of people.
All this is happening, this is the best thing that could ever happen to Thierry. He's the best artisan, most exclusive crafter of carriageway of equipage. The city is being transformed so that this can all be displayed prominently. Social stratifications are becoming more blurry. People can spend money for the first time to buy status. Great for business.
Ben: These are the disruption waves that enabled him to create a business.
David: Yes. Before all this, before this era, there's no way that this evolves into Hermes. Honestly, Louis Vuitton and what he's doing with luggage and with trunks, there's no way that that evolves into Louis Vuitton. Speaking of, both Hermes and Vuitton have one really important client, a key influencer, so to speak, that they both land at this time.
Ben: I remember Louis Vuitton's key client was the Empress Eugenie. Is Hermes the same client?
David: Yes, the same client. Napoleon III's wife, the Empress Eugenie, becomes a client of both of these men for her carriages, in the case of Hermes, and for her luggage and for her trunks. Actually, I think also for her packing. I think Louis Vuitton was the royal laities, I believe, and he packed the trunks. He was the luggage guy, Hermes was the carriage guy.
Ben: Which is so funny because that is still, in some ways, both of their legacy today.
David: Yes, absolutely. Eugenie and everything going on at this time makes Louis Vuitton and makes Thierry Hermes. It's interesting. Vuitton and luggage, that is inherently of the world that's coming, the modern world. The train exists at this point in time, steam engines are a thing, and then the car is about to come, and Louis Vuitton, trunks, and luggage, all translates directly.
Ben: Right, it's built for the upcoming world.
David: Yes. Not the case with Hermès. Actually today, I think this is one of the biggest strengths of Hermes and they still. The equestrian theme, the horse is so much of their brand. They talk about it so much of their products, the saddle stitching. It's calling back to that other era, that pre modern era where the horse was primary.
Ben: Right. Hermes is deeply rooted in French history, in Parisian history, and really a key part of how France as a nation has the identity that it has today.
David: But it would all be irrelevant if the brand didn't translate out of the horse era and into the car era, which was not Thierry Hermes' doing, nor was it his son's doing. Thierry dies in 1878. His son, Charles-Emile, takes over. He apprenticed coming up in the shop in exactly the same way that Thierry apprenticed. He just apprenticed for his dad. By the time he takes over, he's been working in the shop as a craftsman for 20 years.
By the way, this family tradition and way of business continues to this day. Axel Dumas and Pierre-Alexis Dumas, who are the two descendants of Hermes, the sixth generation that are running the company today, Axel is the CEO and Pierre-Alexis is the artistic director, apprenticed in the business. When they were teenagers for five years after school, they went to the atelier, they learned the saddle stitch, they made bags, they made items with their hands.
Obviously, they also learned the business from their parents, but they're not learning the business the way that the Arnault children are learning the business at LVMH as executives. They're learning with their hands as craftspeople how to make this stuff, which is wild. Axel is the CEO of a $200 billion plus company.
Ben: It's crazy. To bring it back to the late 1800s, I think the point you're making here is, when Charles-Emile was apprenticing, there was no other example of what this company could become. He thought, why don't I carry it on in exactly the same manner, Thierry, that you did? There's not this grand ambition to innovate and change with the times, it's well how do I learn exactly your craft exactly the way you do it and then continue that?
David: Right. The business and the craft are intimately intertwined, they cannot be separated. This is a playbook theme I want to pull all the way forward, but it's so critical to understand about Hermes and what really in my mind differentiates it from LVMH. LVMH, as we talked about on that episode, has world class best in the world business executives who partner with world class best in the world creatives.
At Hermes, these are not different people. Obviously, there is a different CEO and artistic director that are both members of the same family and who are cousins. But in spirit, they're cut from the same cloth, they apprentice as creative craftspeople, and they collectively and the family, is in charge as much of the creative side of the house as they are of the business side.
Ben: Yeah, makes sense.
David: Back to Charles-Emile and the second generation, he finally adds saddlery to the business. That's his big expansion, he adds saddles. Again, as Paris is modernizing as you can now buy your way into status, for the first time in Paris, you couldn't be seen riding in addition to carriages.
The ideal of what it is to be a noble person or a noble person of status has changed. It's no longer just, oh, I'm a leisurely courtier. It's like, no, I'm Baron Haussmann. I am doing things for the state, for the country. It's like America in its way and the Rockefellers.
Ben: Right. You're not just famous for being famous, you are famous because you've achieved something, you're in the act of achieving something, or you hold a high office in which you were elected or appointed to get a specific goal done. You're on the move. You got stuff to do, and you got to get there.
David: Exactly, and you need a saddle for that. Charles-Émile adds saddles. In 1880, he moves the workshop in the store to 24 rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré in the 8th arrondissement of Paris.
Ben: The famous address.
David: The building that is today known as Le Faubourg by everybody in the Hermes universe. This street and this location is one of the most iconic streets in the world, buildings in the world, headquarters in the world.
Ben: It was stunning to walk it last summer when I was there. You can feel the presence of Hermes and all the other brands that are there.
David: Yeah, the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré is where the French presidential residence is. It's where the British embassy is. It's where French Vogue is today, probably because Hermès is there and because all of the other luxury flagships are there.
Charles Emile runs the business for 25 years. He adds saddles, he moves the company to the Faubourg. In 1902, he retires. His two sons, Adolphe and Emile, who have apprenticed in the business just like him, just like every generation will do for many generations to come, take over. They change the name of the company to Hermes Freres, Hermes Brothers, because the two brothers are now running the company.
Ben: And they're going to do this forever together, and they're going to be thick as thieves. They are of one mind on how this company should go.
David: They've been apprenticed together, going to be like Axel and Pierre-Alexis today. Of the two brothers, I think it is fair to say that Emile, who I believe is the younger brother, is the much more ambitious and much more adventurous one.
There's this great story that in the late 1890s, before his father Charles-Emile retires, the young Emile sets off to conquer Russia for Hermes. He literally gets on a train with a notebook and a suitcase filled with miniature versions of the saddles and the harnesses that Hermes makes. He just finds his way into the Tsar of Russia's court and lands him as a customer.
Ben: That is wild.
David: Unreal. They have to staff up a whole new atelier with 80 craftspeople to fulfill all the orders for the Tsar in Russia.
Ben: Whoa.
David: Yeah. This is Emile. He's going places. Right as he and Adolphe are taking over at the end of Charles-Emile's tenure, they decide to introduce a new product. They're not thinking that this is going to be a big thing at the time. Some of their customers, again, now that they've added saddles, once they get off the horse, they want something to carry the saddle and maybe their riding boots with them while the horse is in the stables wherever they're going.
They say, great, we can help you with this. They introduce the Haut a Courroies bag, which translates as the high belted bag to carry saddles and boots for their clients. Like I'm saying here, this was intended to be an accessory to the main business of équipage and saddles, the equestrian business. It's not really practical for anything else. I don't know why anybody else would want a big tote bag that could carry your boots.
Ben: What's this bag look like?
David: This bag looks exactly like the Birkins and the Kellys today, except a lot bigger.
Ben: Interesting. Because you're putting a whole saddle in it, like you're de-saddling your horse, and then you're putting that in this bag?
David: Yup, but it has the same trapezoid shape. It has the crossover belt, the Haut a Courroies that means the high belted bag. It has the belt. It has the turnstile lock closure for the belt at the top of the bag.
Ben: Fascinating.
David: This accessory that we're going to add to the business becomes the spiritual heritage to the business today.
Ben: That's crazy. It's like if Apple eventually transitioned to being not the Vision Pro company, but the Vision Pro carrying case company.
David: Yes. Did you get the carry case by the way?
Ben: No, I'm not going to spend another $200 on that.
David: That thing looks like a balloon. It's enormous.
Ben: Yes, and it takes up your whole backpack.
David: This bag, this accessory that would become the Kelly and then the Birkin, they introduced it just at the right time. It's 1902, as Charles-Emile is retiring. This idea of this bag that you would put stuff in, because you wouldn't bring a bag on a train—if you're of this class, you need a trunk. You need a flat pack trunk that Louis Vuitton is going to make for you. None of these three men could have seen it at the time, but this accessory to the real business of saddles, horses, and harnesses was going to become the perfect transition to move Hermes into the age of the automobile. Before we tell that story...
Ben: Yes, we mentioned Hermes founded in 1837 as the oldest company we've covered on Acquired, but we might have to caveat that.
Ben: Now, David, how was Hermes perfectly positioned for the age of the automobile with this new accessory?
David: This is wild. I suspect you probably also found this in research, but when I did, my mind melted. During World War I, in 1916, Emile becomes an officer in the French military. The military sends him to the United States to learn about US industrial and military production. He's a leading industrialist in France at this time, shall we say? One of the people that he gets sent to meet with is, do you know about this, Ben?
Ben: No, I have no idea.
David: I can't believe you didn't find this.
Ben: No.
David: He meets with Henry Ford. He goes to Detroit. He sees the assembly lines. He sees the car, he sees the future.
Ben: He sees the assembly lines and then he had blinders on? He's like, oh, pay no attention to the manufacturing efficiencies they've got going on over there.
David: This is what's so funny. No, he's like, this is unbelievable. To the manufacturing efficiency's point, he actually does take some elements of the assembly lines and brings them back to Hermes. It's not like they're anti-efficiency. They're pro efficiency, but in the context of being a craft, non-mechanized human master craftsman built object.
He actually does take some of the production ideas from Henry Ford, but more importantly, he's looking at this place and he's like, my God, there is a Model T rolling off the assembly line every three minutes. Ford at this point is producing half a million cars per year. Everybody knew about the automobile, but this is a different arrow. This is the same time as when we talked about our Novo Nordisk episode about the start of that company, where news didn't reach Europe. This wasn't a global world. Emile getting this window, literally seeing the assembly lines in Detroit, he's like, whoa, Once this war is over, the world is going to change forever.
Ben: Okay. Emile both figures out how to open business in Russia and goes to America, meets with Henry Ford, understands the automobile is going to change the world.
David: Yeah, he's quite the character, this guy. The other thing he finds in America is, I know you know this one, the zipper.
Ben: Yes, or as it was originally called...
David: The close-all.
Ben: Yes, which really does not have the same ring to it, I'm glad we changed it to zipper.
David: I couldn't believe this. The zipper was a late 1800s, early 1900s invention in America. It was primarily used for Industrial use cases. In this case, it was zippering closed the hood of a car,
Ben: I think a military car.
David: Yeah, where Emile first sees it. It's not at the Ford factory. I think it actually might have been in Canada on the later leg of his journey where he sees it on the car. It was also used for opening and closing boots. That is how the name zipper came to be. I think it was the BF Goodrich company.
Ben: Really?
David: Yeah, I believe they made a brand of boot with this close-all function and they called it the zipper, and that's where the zipper came from. Regardless, enterprising young Emile, he tracks down the inventor of the zipper, the holder of the patent in America. He obtains an exclusive license for two years in France. This literally is like the Novo Nordisk episode.
Ben: Totally.
David: It brings it back to France and makes the first zippered products. He makes the first zippered jacket ever created anywhere in the world. It is a leather golf jacket for the British Duke of Windsor, the heir to the throne. It's just amazing. For years in France, the zipper would be called the Hermes fastener in France.
Ben: Yes, that's right.
David: Just wild. I think they made the right decision not to make zippers the business and instead to stay focused on leather goods.
Ben: It does show their penchant for innovation, the idea that we can push the envelope forward in functionality and what people would be willing to wear. This guy's a duke, and he's wearing a zippered jacket. I'd imagine that drew some eyes at first.
David: Yeah, and a golf jacket literally for use while playing golf, while playing sport. What more modern activity to happen here? Regardless though, the big thing for Hermes that he brings back is, oh, my God, the car is coming.
Ben: Okay. We're still in Hermes family. Two brothers are running it. What's next?
David: When Emile comes back and he's running around making zippered jackets, he's collaborating with car companies, it leads to a rift between the two brothers. Adolphe, the older brother, he's much more conservative. He wants to remain in the horse market. He's depressed about the car coming. He's like, hey, I just want to remain a niche leather worker. I'm not really cool with everything you're doing here.
Ben: This is literally like he wants faster horses of the analogy of like, if you would ask people what they want, they'd say a faster horse. He's stuck in horse land.
David: Right. I don't know if it was that he had his head in the sand or more just like he didn't want to go build a big company.
Ben: Right, which I could understand.
David: Totally, I can totally understand that. Either way, in 1919, Emile buys him out and says, I believe in my ability to lead this company, making this transition into the automobile era. Legend has it that he goes to the craftsman in the atelier above the shop in the Faubourg and says, okay, what are we going to do? What can we make with our hands here in this atelier that will interest our clients today?
I think this is still legend around Hermes of like, what can we make with our hands that will interest our clients today? The obvious answer at the time is a version of the Haut a Courroies bag. It's bags for these cars. If you want the most exquisite bags, the most exquisite things to show in your automobiles that you're buying, who better than Hermes and finely handcrafted leather bags and accessories that you can outfit your car in the same way you could outfit your horse?
Ben: The business is now a meals and the business is now handbags.
David: Once again, the timing and insight here like Thierry in the original case, what the automobile does, and it's not just automobiles, it's also improvements to trains and improvements to ships, the global rich, the global elite, start traveling a lot more. We're now in the 1920s, the roaring 20s.
This is what F. Scott Fitzgerald is writing about. The visible symbols of wealth. It's when you're home, it's in your car and the bags and the accessories you're using with your car. But you're also out traveling a lot more, you're rubbing shoulders with elite all around the world.
The American elite are going to France. They're going to Europe, vice versa. People are starting to travel around the world. People are traveling to Asia. People are traveling to the Middle East. People are traveling to South America. Emile's going right along with all these people. Your luggage, your bags, that's what you bring with you. That's what you show.
Ben: Yeah. Importantly, it's not just that you're trying to show a label, which is a little bit different than the modern version of luxury. It's that you're trying to have something really nicely crafted. When you show up somewhere, someone should just look at your luggage and go, wow, that is beautiful. Hermes is not yet a recognized brand, so merely slapping Hermes on it won't do the trick. The way to wow the people that you want to wow is through the raw craftsmanship.
David: The product itself, yes. In 1922, Emile's wife famously complains that the large bag they've been making, the Haut a Courroies, the saddlebag, it's too large to fit through car doors, so she asks for a smaller version. This launches the handbag business in 1925.
Ben: By the way, by this point, they've put the zipper on a handbag.
David: Yes, exactly. Speaking of the zipper in 1925, they had ready to wear clothes like the legacy of the golf jacket here. The legend has it that they added clothes because a long time client came in and said, I am fed up with seeing my horse better dressed than me. Who knows if that's true, but it's a nice story. But they really go into this. In this modern world where the global wealthy, the global elite, are traveling, they're seeing each other, what outward signifiers can they supply them? Clothes, in 1927 they had jewelry, in 1928 they had watches.
Ben: Something interesting that is different than the Hermes you know today, the way that they're adding all of these things, they're finding crafts people who are experts at particular crafts. Exactly what you're talking about, David, a watchmaker. They're finding a watchmaker and they're saying, can we work with you on designing something uniquely Hermes, but you're the craftsperson? We're not trying to build this competency in-house.
David: It's not right to say that they're licensing products. It is a collaboration, but they are selling products in their stores that are not made end to end by Hermes employed craftsmen.
Ben: Right. It's interesting, because they're towing this line between first and foremost being a craftsman themselves, being a manufacturer, and being a designer, but also being a retailer, where they're just bringing in other branded goods and selling it in their shop.
David: Yes. I think all this is being figured out real time. These ideas of retailers versus brands, it was a much fuzzier line then than it was today. What does Hermes do? What does Emile do? They start opening up stores outside of Paris. Where are they going to go? They're going to go to the travel destinations where their clients are going. The first store is in the Côte d'Azur in the south of France, and then they start opening up more stores around the world, again, not necessarily in the Londons, the Romes, or the New Yorks of the world. They're opening them up in the travel destinations.
Ben: Their mindset around additional stores at this point is it's for the same clientele in all the places that they travel.
David: Yes, and the clientele was primarily French at this point in time.
Ben: Yeah, or if not exclusively other than the czar.
David: I suspect though that it was strategic of like, our French clients are going to go to these places, they're going to rub shoulders with the Americans, with the British, and then we're going to have a store there so that those Americans, those British, elite, can go purchase our products there too.
Ben: Right. This, by the way, is a different retail strategy than what they have today. Today, management insists that the idea is that each store is for the local clientele. We will only expand into an area if we feel that we can serve the local clientele that lives there well. That's a recognition of the maturation of their business. The rich people are going to go find an Hermes store somewhere. It's easy for them to travel somewhere, buy it on vacation. But if we're going to open new stores, we should open it in places where there is a thriving new upper class who can buy the goods locally there in their city.
David: Yes. Now, I think some element of this certainly still exists. You had a nice time going into the Hermes store in X, right?
Ben: Yes, for sure. But it plays well for me as someone who is on vacation and shopping to believe that I'm shopping in a store that is for the locals. It's less fun to be shopping somewhere that is very clearly created for you as a tourist.
David: Yeah, I think they very brilliantly walk this line. The products that the shops carry are very different. We'll get into that later in the episode too. Back to this era, I think we've laid the groundwork of a few critical components of Hermes so far. First and most importantly, the craftsmanship, these things are handmade by artisans with their hands, and the family and the people who own the company are the chief artisans. That goes all the way back to Thierry.
We've talked about the connection to the legacy of French nobility, but not really French nobility. It's like status, but accessible status for the first time in the world and the modernization of the world. We've talked now here about the true modernization of the company in the transition to the automobile era. What we haven't talked about yet and what Hermes at this point certainly is not is this element of whimsy and art that is really, really critical, I think, to the company.
Ben: Yes. If you've ever been in an Hermes store, you can feel a warmth that doesn't exist in other luxury stores. If you're in a destination with a lot of luxury shops, you'll walk past a lot of bright lights, mirrors, punch you in the face reds, and black and white, and you just feel like there's a lot going on. Then you arrive at Hermes, and it feels warm, it feels soft, it feels welcoming, and it feels whimsical. There's this almost dreamlike color palette that they use, starting with a base of orange and having this explosive rainbow of fun, but in some ways it all feels natural, from the earth, and just whimsy. I think that you nailed it, David, whimsical.
David: This I think is really a very different thread than the original leather craftsmanship, and it is a critical one in the weaving of the Hermes business. This thread comes from the next generation of the family, specifically Robert Dumas. Emile had four children, but they were all daughters. Tragically, one died young, but the other three grew up and got married. Back in this day, women weren't going to take over the business, unfortunately.
Ben: Right, same story as the New York times. There was a whole generation of daughters, none of the ox daughters get the business, so it goes over to the son in law, the souls burger, and now it's the souls burger ox family that owns the business in the same way that Hermes is the Hermes-Dumas family. The son in law tends to do well in this early 20th century period of passing it down from, unfortunately, father not to daughter, but father to son-in-law.
David: In this case, when you read about the Hermes family fortune today, it's the Dumas family that are obviously the CEO and the artistic director that you hear about visibly. But really, I think all the sons-in-laws and all of their descendants become active in the business. There's Robert Dumas, there's Jean-René Guérin, and there's Francis Puech.
Ben: And these are all son-in-laws.
David: These are all son-in-laws. Those are the three family names that you still hear about to this day of the Hermès family. Back to Robert Dumas and the fourth generation, he brings this whimsy and real art into the business.
Ben: The way Hermes describes it today when you read their annual report is they talk about their trademark humor and imaginative flair. Despite the fact that they really are tied to this old French elite, they really don't take themselves too seriously in all their products, especially the entry level ones. The Birkin is the Birkin. Yeah, they'll do some special editions here and there, but there's a weight to that product line. There's an overall playfulness that's exuded from the brand that comes from this era of leadership.
David: Totally, and this comes from Robert. One of the first things he does when he joins the business is he redesigns the smaller Haut a Courroies bag, the handbag line, into what he calls the Sac a Depeches in 1935.
Ben: Really great name. It's got a ring to it. I feel like that's going to go be a viral hit and appear on Sex in the City.
David: Beautiful, beautiful, elegant bag.
Ben: Sac a Depeches. Hold on to that one, listeners.
David: Yup. A little later in the 1930s, he introduces the Chaine d'ancre bracelet, which is another iconic Hermes item in their jewelry métier.
Ben: Wait, David, I can't let you get away with that métier. Please enlighten listeners. I know Hermes sprinkles around French words in all their literature, and it just expects Americans to deal with it. If it's italicized, it's French. You can go look up what it means yourself here on Acquired. David, tell us about a métier.
David: A métier is someone's work, but in the craftsman's sense. A métier is like a trade. It's like a craft profession. This is what Hermes calls their divisions. I feel gross even just saying the word divisions. There are 16 of them today, and jewelry, of course, is one of the métiers. I feel so much better saying métier.
Ben: I bet, yeah. There's a levity here in the room now.
David: Chaine d'ancre in French means chain of anchors, anchor chain. These are anchors like boat anchors. The way that this bracelet comes about is Robert is walking along the beach in Normandy one day, and he's just inspired by the scene of these boat anchors on this foggy beach, so he makes a little sketch in his notebook. He plays with it, and then he decides he's going to turn this into a bracelet.
Ben: Love it. An important thing to know here is when you're buying Hermes products, they're really not pushing the brand. There is not an iconic, recognizable Hermes H, horse and carriage logo, or bright color that you're supposed to identify. This is really the origin of quiet luxury, where Hermes is handcrafting the highest quality product they can make a single artisan is the person making the good. When you receive it, you really are just aware that it's the highest quality thing made by a single person with their blood, sweat, tears, love, a piece of them left inside.
It's super different than luxury today because it is just not branded, and Hermes hadn't even really developed the iconography yet that would become a Hermes' version of slightly louder luxury. Over the years, if you look at products now, the belts have an H. They incorporate horse motifs into designs on their ready-to-wear clothing, but that really wasn't a thing yet in this era.  Hermes is on the lighter side of branding their goods today, but it's still...
David: They have to adapt to the market.
Ben: The customers want some way to let people know that they're wearing an Hermes item, even if it's lower key than other luxury brands, so Hermes builds that for them.
David: The family talks about this a lot. The words they use is this is not a museum. There is this artistic element to what we do, but we are not a museum. We are a business, we have clients, and we are here to serve our clients. There is this push pull here.
Ben: Yes. Okay, what year are we that the bracelet is entering the market?
David: That was in the mid 30s. In 1937, Robert introduces the other key pillar of Hermes products that is less talked about today relative to the bags and the leather goods, but for many, many decades was the bigger business.
Ben: Yes, I have numbers on this.
David: Silk scarves, the Hermes classic silk scarves. This is the embodiment of this art and whimsy that we're talking about. The silks that they use are the finest silks in the world. It takes 300 silk moth cocoons per scarf, as they will readily tell you to produce these things. But the designs on them, the artwork on them are whimsical like we said.
The first design, the Jeu des Omnibus et Dames Blanches or the white ladies at play, I guess you could translate that, is based on a woodblock engraving that Robert does. This is what an artist this guy is. He's about to become CEO of Hermes, but he's making woodblock engravings and then making silk scarves out of them. That's the first design that they put out there, and quickly they become a huge, huge phenomenon with Hermes clients.
Ben: Yeah. Fast forward all the way to 1988, when Axel Dumas has his very first internship with the company, this is crazy. Silk was 55% of the company's sales. Leather was only 9%. You compare that to today, it is a completely different story. Leather is 43% and silk and textiles is 7%. There was a run. This was introduced when, David, the 30s?
David: 1937.
Ben: 1937 through probably the 1990s, these silk scarves were the Hermes franchise. The reason this took off is it almost became part of the French woman's uniform to have an Hermes scarf as a part of your outfit.
David: It's funny you say the French woman's uniform. Yes, that is entirely true, but the woman who really popularizes them around the globe is a British woman, specifically Queen Elizabeth.
Ben: I didn't realize that. Really?
David: Yeah. This is so iconic, Queen Elizabeth. She starts wearing them as head scarves in the 1940s. Queen Elizabeth, she's queen of England for 60, 70 years, and she's wearing these scarves, these whimsical, playful scarves on her head as the queen of England.
Ben: Fascinating. This is a good time to talk about how these silk scarves are made. I was going to do this later when we talk about their modern day production process, but it turns out that their modern day production process is not that different than it used to be. Here is how Hermes scarves are made today. They are first sourcing the finest silk that they can find, which is now from their owned farms in Brazil. That's where the silk comes from. Only 20 new designs are created every year and they retire old designs. There's a Disney vault aspect to this.
David: They'll bring them out of the vault.
Ben: Yes. The pipeline to get a new design into the customers hands is two years. You might be asking yourself like, come on, why is this taking two years? That's a ridiculous thing. Here is the process. They screen print every single scarf by hand.
David: Yeah, there's no digital process here. It's not like you're going to custommake.com and ordering up some Hermes scarves.
Ben: Right. Some of the design does seem like it involves computers now. If you watch documentaries about the craftsman at Hermes, which there's a couple of good ones we'll link to in the show notes if you want to just watch Hermes crafts people at work, they do seem to be translating designs off of a computer, but it's not like they're hitting command P. That's not how this works. Every single color. of the scarf is screen printed using its own mask, or basically a stencil. If your scarf has 20 colors, it has at least 20 masks that they then squeegee the ink over, and the precision is perfect.
David: This is like EUV lithography.
Ben: Yes, I was looking at my wife's twilly scarf, the little wrist or hair tie scarf that we got in Aix-en Provence. I don't know how you do this by hand, and I don't know how you do it by hand 20 times over and over and over for every single layer. If you've ever been to an Hermes store or you own one of these, you just can't believe that this is done by hand without any of the layers being out of alignment. Because if any of them are out of alignment, you ruin the whole thing and you have to start over.
If that's not enough, the masks are also hand etched by a craftsperson. Their entire job is to know how to translate a design into all the different color layers, which they then hand etch. The pipeline is designer, engraver, that's an engraver of each mask, colorist, weaver, printer, and then someone to do the finishing.
David: All of which are extremely hard to replicate and involve both extreme craftsmanship and extreme taste. The competitive barriers to the Hermes scarf, I think they're way higher than the bags, honestly, even though the bags are a bigger business now.
Ben: The skills are completely non transferable. This process doesn't really exist, certainly not at scale at any other company. Actually, I was talking to my wife about this. She brought up the idea that it's like Disney imagineers or almost like Pixar employees, where you specialize in this one crazy little piece of the production process that no other company has your same production process. The attention to detail is so staggering that once you enter the Hermes universe, then you're in that universe for the rest of your career because that is where your trade is still practiced.
David: I think also, as a client too, at least in scarves, if you entered the Hermes scarf universe, you're not buying any other scarves.
Ben: Totally, and you really like all the lore. Part of what makes Hermes Hermes at this point is their callbacks to their own history. They have a hundred and eighty seven years of history to call upon, and they do so over and over and over again. They remix and they name things after stores that used to exist at certain addresses. It's a universe.
David: Yeah. I remember growing up and my mom is half British. I'm a quarter British. To the Queen Elizabeth thing, my mom's Hermes scarves were and are among her most treasured items. You'll note all of this that's happening,  Robert, the innovations, these new products, the art, the whimsy, he's doing all this in the 1930s. This is the Great Depression era. This tells you about Hermes and Hermes clients. They are unaffected. They keep buying. This carries through right to this day. I don't know that there is a more recession insulated business than Hermes.
Ben: You're exactly right. Twelve months now after we did the LVMH episode, we're finally on the tail end of this pandemic bubble of luxury, and we're seeing a lot of these brands take a hit. Hermes is the most insulated of all the luxury brands, where they have the least cost sensitive clients.
David: After this, there's World War II. Famously, before the war, Hermes products came in cream colored boxes. Robert was very meticulous about the packaging that his crafted items and his art would come in, and it was cream. It had to be cream. During the war, there's a shortage of packaging materials, they can't get cream. The only color that is available to them in the quantities that they need is orange. That was designed for patisseries, for bakeries.
Ben: Is that what the orange ones were used for?
David: That's why there was an excess of it because it was used for bakeries, and bakeries weren't baking as many croissants and pain au chocolat during the war, et cetera. There's all this orange packing material. Robert embraces it, and the Hermes orange box is born. This is crazy. I didn't know this till research. Hermes owns this color. You cannot get Hermes orange anywhere else. Pantone does not list it in their colors.
Ben: It's interesting you say Hermes owns this color. You are correct that Hermes has selected a non Pantone color, but what Hermes tries to do is say, well, we own orange. We can't be nailed down by a Pantone specific code, we own orange more broadly. They've actually gone head to head with the EU. This has gone to court where it's been determined that no, you can't own orange. You can't just own all the oranges.
David: Amazing.
Ben: What they've done is they've actually leaned into this, where there is a classic Hermes orange, but it presents differently on each of the leathers. They have 10 different leathers or something like that that they work with. When they die those leathers, it presents a little bit differently. They have this, sure, there's a digital perfect representation of the color of classic orange, but there's this whole spectrum of the way that it shows up on leather. They've even further winked at all of us by creating five or six other oranges.
They have Hermes fue, which is the fire. They have Hermes sanguine, which is this red hot orange like lava. Or they have the Hermes moutarde, which is their mustard. Each of these is a little bit of, I think it's to continue to assert that we own the whole spectrum of oranges, but it's definitely to be able to stay current, stay present, encapsulate the theme of a season, because every year they pick a theme, so they play with their oranges a little bit to evoke the whimsy that they want from this year's theme.
David: Yeah. There's this metal level or corporate level playfulness to this too, of we own all the oranges.
Ben: Totally. The Hermes oranges are almost to continue the Disney analogy. It's almost like the people that go to the park and look for the hidden Mickeys. It's a way to even more deeply participate in the Hermes universe.
David: A few other things that Robert adds over the years, he adds the men's silks métiers, aka ties.  The legend behind that one is pretty great. Supposedly a number of gentlemen were refused entry to the casino, thus went to the neighboring Hermes shop next door, and said, can you take some of your beautiful silk scarves that cut and tailor them into ties for us so that we can enter the casino? I'm sure that's apocryphal, but adds to the legend here.
Ben: They are these patterns. They're just as intricate as the scarves. There's less storytelling that happens in the tie. The scarves tend to be something you could frame, put on the wall, look at in 16 different ways, and the story behind it. When you look at it, you can't believe that it was hand screen printed.
David: Totally. After World War II, Robert decides that Hermes needs a logo. Taking inspiration from the 19th century painting, le Duc Attele, Groom a L'Attente, which means Hitched Carriage Waiting Groom, the famous Hermes logo is born. The logo is the callback to the carriage. It's the nobility. I find it really interesting, especially at that point in time that Robert decided. You could imagine a galloping horse or something like that would be the appropriate logo.
Ben: No, it's so genius.
David: No, it's the carriage.
Ben: Yes, it's to intentionally ground the brand in history in something that they were a part of that is only theirs, because nobody else starting today is going to have that as a part of their history. They're leaning into the thing that makes them unique, special. The almost defensible durable asset that they have is that they participated in that era that has a nostalgia about it.
David: And no longer exists.
Ben: Yes.
David: Horses in the equestrian world still exists. It's obviously not what it once was, but it still exists. The carriage world is gone. It's just a dream these days, and that's what Robert is so good at, this dream. The other thing we have to talk about are the window displays. You referenced this a little bit earlier.
He hires first, Annie Beaumel, and then she's soon joined by the legendary Leila Menchari. Specifically, these two women come from theater set design just to design the window displays at the Faubourg at the flagship store on the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honore. There are whole museum exhibits just dedicated to these window displays.
It's not like, again, you walk by XYZ other store, even the most prestigious brands and it's like the products are there. Here are the products, here's the brand you're buying, here's the LV, et cetera. These displays, it's a dream. There are probably some Hermes products in there, but it's like a museum exhibit. It's artwork.
Ben: Yes, and art is exactly the right way to put it. There is no utility to these displays. These displays, much like any advertising that you see of Hermes today, it's not about the product, it's about how you feel. I think this is an interesting place to revisit this idea that we talked about on the LVMH episode of luxury versus premium, where premium means you pay more and you get more utility out of a given product.
I pay for a bigger storage space on my iPhone and I get more utility out of that. I can store more photos. Luxury means you pay more literally because it doesn't create more utility. It is either more pleasing to you intrinsically for the feeling, or it's an extrinsic signal where you are signaling to others that you have the means to spend on this item, even though it doesn't provide more utility. It's a despite rather than a because.
Art does fall on this spectrum. Art is like luxury taken to its logical extreme. It has actually zero utility. A Birkin bag is a piece of art, but at least it also carries your stuff around. Luxury products are this interesting midpoint between extreme functionality but also artwork. When you buy an air mass product, you aren't just buying the product, you're buying a piece of art a piece of their heritage, a feeling that connects you to the maker and the place it was created.
You're trying to buy a piece of Hermes' heritage and reputation, and hoping to adopt it as a part of you, as a part of your identity. You are seeking whether it's conscious or not to let other people know about this too. You're not necessarily trying to signal it to everyone, but you do want to signal it to the right people who would appreciate it.
David: There's this genius aspect to what Hermes is doing and what Robert's doing with the arts like these window displays. The Luxury Strategy book talks a lot about this. When you're selling luxury items, they can't just be art. They need to have some utility to them. You will never see any of these brands, Hermes included, become art galleries. They're not selling paintings, but it's critical for luxury brands to have a connection to the arts.
I think you realize this before anybody of like, the windows in our stores are these portals into this world of dream and art. You'll come in and you'll buy a scarf that you'll wear. You'll buy a bag that you'll use. Maybe you'll buy a tie, maybe you'll buy a wallet, homewares, furniture, or any of the other things over time that they sell. That will have utility, but it's connected to this dream.
Ben: Yes, you're taking a piece of that dream with you, and it's almost a daily reminder of the dream that you're now participating in. The key insight is that by adopting art as a critical piece of the bundle that is your product. It enables you as the seller to completely switch tracks to disconnect from any evaluation of value.
David: Right, or features.
Ben: Exactly. You're out of the feeds and speeds world. You are not being comped against, well, this other purse is much cheaper and serves the same function. Now, we have bundled in the function of the object and an unevaluatable...
David: Priceless feeling.
Ben: A priceless feeling. Now, we can sell the goods for whatever we want, because it's impossible to know the value of that second component that we've bundled in.
David: Yeah, totally. Speaking of dreams, we're now in the 1950s in the post World War II era, the most amazing, unbelievable, fantastical dream of the 1950s happens to Hermes in real life. That dream is Princess Grace Kelly.
I mentioned a little while back that one of the first things that Robert did when he came into the business was redesign the handbag and christen it the Sac a Depeches. It becomes popular, but we're talking about leather goods, handbags, important, but that was the previous generation of the business. Now under Robert, it's the scarves, it's the dream, it's all this stuff. Leather's part of it, but a smaller part.
In 1956, Princess Grace Kelly of Monaco, this is a girl from Philadelphia, an American girl who goes on to become a movie star, who then goes on to become Princess Grace of Monaco. I can't imagine a bigger dream for any woman or any person in the 1950s. She is photographed using the Sac a Depeches in Life magazine.
Ben: On the cover of Life magazine.
David: The legend is that it was on the cover of Life magazine, but I googled a lot of 1956 covers of Life magazine, and I didn't find it on the cover.
Ben: Interesting. Maybe that's been played up over time.
David: This might have become part of the lore. Regardless, big picture in Life magazine. She is clutching her beloved Sac a Depeches to her midsection.
Ben: It's almost like as she's exiting a building. It almost seems like it's a paparazzi type photo.
David: It's a paparazzi photo. Her husband, Prince Rainier of Monaco is holding the door behind her. It's the most dreamlike thing you could imagine. It's in black and white. The reason that she is clutching this fairly large bag, unbeknownst to the world at the time, is she's trying to hide her pregnancy from the paparazzi. She's pregnant with her first daughter.
This photo just becomes iconic. Everybody wants to be Grace Kelly. Everybody wants to have this bag. One of the last things that Robert does right before he retires in 1977 is he officially changes the product name of the Sac a Depeches to the Kelly bag. This is the birth of, I don't even know what to call it. The Kelly and the Birkin are ends of ones, but these leather good products that transcend everything, that are so truly N of one. There's no other way to describe them.
Ben: There is so much to say about these bags, how they're crafted, the lore around them, and the supply, demand, and the econ 101.
Ben: Okay, David, Life magazine, the Kelly bag. It's out. This thing must sell like hotcakes, right?
David: Yes and no. Certainly, this plays right into this whole dream thing that we've been talking about and burnishes Hermes' already incredible brand and image. My god, Princess Grace Kelly of Monaco is carrying this bag, not just carrying this bag, but it's her favorite bag, the closest thing to her body. But we're still in the fifties here, so yes, it becomes incredibly popular.
Yes, I'm pretty sure it becomes Hermes's biggest selling bag, but the market isn't quite there yet in the way that it is today with the Birkins and the Kellys. The global rich isn't that big of a population. I'm sure they're all buying Kellys, but Robert probably knows all of these clients personally at this point. We're not anywhere near the scale that we're talking about today.
Ben: To your point, I keep saying it's launched. It's not really launch, they just rebrand to the Kelly bag. When the Kelly bag is formally launched, it's really expensive. It's a $900 handbag in the 50s, which today is $10,000-$12,000, approximately the price of a Kelly bag today. It comes out that as this thing that is completely ridiculous and inaccessible price wise, the people who are buying it are the Grace Kellys of the world, and there's not really this stratified class below that that's got this huge amount of purchasing power.
David: Right. The number of people who could spend the equivalent of $12,000 on a bag back then was just much, much, much smaller than it is today.
Ben: Yup, exactly. No, handbags do not immediately become a huge part of the business or I should say the dominant whatever it is today, six or seven times larger than silk part of the business right away.
David: In fact, actually, sadly, quite the opposite happens. As we head through the 60s and into the 1970s and the end of Robert's tenure and his generation as the head of Hermes, the company starts to fall on hard times.
Ben: Which is crazy to say. I remember this moment in the Porsche episode, you're like, no, come on, Porsche skinnied down the entire lineup to only making the 911 because they couldn't justify any of the other products, and the whole company was a freaking mess. Hermes is not quite in those dire of straits, but they have the ingredients of Hermes that we know today. They've got the Kelly bag, they've got the orange box. They've adopted the logo.
David: They've got the scarves.
Ben: They've got the scarves. They have these small workshops where they make everything, but it's not working yet.
David: It's particularly not working because like we just talked about, that market was not that big yet. As we entered the 1970s, something really funny happens. The next generation rejects that dream. This is you and me, our parents' generation, the hippies, the 1970s. This is democratization. Little girls don't want to be Grace Kelly anymore. They want to be Stevie Nicks or something like that.
The dream of Hermes that was once so elegant and so desired by so many people but inaccessible, it certainly still got its audience, but it's not as universal. This is when so many of the other what we now think of as luxury brands really start to come up. We talked about this on the LVMH episode, but they're connected to fashion. It's first Dior, and then it's Yves Saint Laurent. This is the Mondrian dress from Yves Saint Laurent. This is the revolution. It's Gucci. It's Chanel in the 80s when Karl Lagerfeld takes over. What they're selling is very, very, very different than what Hermes is selling.
Ben: This is an important distinction between Hermes and all the brands you just named. They come from the world of couture, of fashion, and of cutting edge, in your face, risky art. Mind you, by this point, they're already 120 years old, 130 years old. They come from the world of leather, horses, durable goods that stand the test of time, and frankly, styles that stand the test of time. It's not how creative and crazy we can be, they talk about it as responsible growth.
What's the smallest amount that we can move from our current compass in order to do what our clientele wants while staying true to our roots? It's a rejection of risk and an almost embrace of history. It's super different than most other luxury brands, which as you point out come from fashion.
David: Right, and those brands are getting born or reborn right there in the 1970s.
Ben: Yes. David, this is probably a good time to share who we chatted with in preparation from this episode and his observation about Hermes.
David: Yes. This was super cool. One of the things that for me and for both of us just blows our mind as Acquired grows. We got to talk with Domenico De Sole, who was CEO of Gucci, during the fight with Bernard Arnault that we chronicled. Really, I think that was the best part of our LVMH episode.
Ben: Absolutely. When Domenico De Sole, Tom Ford, and that team rejected Bernard's takeover and managed to not become a part of LVMH. Obviously, then Domenico and Tom Ford left to start Tom Ford after that.
David: It was super cool. We talked to Domenico. He comes from that world. Even with the heritage of Gucci, he and Tom, it was fashion first in his perspective. I think the perspective of many folks that are coming out of this 70s, 80s era of luxury, that's what's interesting. That's what's fresh.
Ben: Risk on, baby.
David: Risk on, yeah.
Ben: Let's figure out how to break some glass in what we're doing.
David: Grace Kelly is not breaking any glass.
Ben: Right. That Domenico helped us understand about Hermes is they have been so protective of their brand and this unbelievable steward. They're so careful at how they've chosen to deploy the brand. They make sure that the mystique is always there. They don't violate the promise. They never cut corners.
They have been above board in their brand promise and keeping that promise with customers for over a hundred years. That is a strength and a weakness. It's a strength as long as you learn how to employ it as a strength. In the world of fashion, it's butting heads.
David: Yeah, it's antithetical to fashion.
Ben: Yes, exactly.
David: All this culminates towards the end of the 1970s as Robert is nearing the end of his tenure at Hermès and the end of his life. Sadly, there's a moment. This is in probably 1977 or so, where they bring in consultants and the consultants recommend like, hey, you guys should probably do what Gucci is doing. You should probably close the atelier above the shop at the Faubourg, you should probably outsource production, and you should probably increase your number of products, your SKUs, have lower prices, and have them be more accessible.
Ben: Unbelievable.
David: That was the accepted wisdom at the time. I don't know if it was McKinsey or who was saying that.
Ben: Today, I will tell you that Hermes has a corporate policy of no consultants, and now I know where that came from.
David: This is enshrined in the luxury strategy is anti law of marketing number 19, do not hire consultants.
Ben: Wow. The recommendation was to come in and destroy everything that makes you special and follow the playbook that everyone else is running.
David: Yeah. It's working for them, and it's not working for Hermes.
Ben: It's crazy.
David: This is when the next generation transition happens to Robert's son, Jean-Louis Dumas. I can't believe it with this family. Every time they come in at a generational transfer, and the company and the brand is under existential threat, even though we think of Hermes as the most unassailable thing in the world right now, but finds itself at a moment where it can be assailed. There's a generational transfer happening. You would think this is the downward spiral. This is the dropping of the baton, and the next generation always rallies.
Ben: Isn't it amazing? You would think the best person out there to brilliantly come up with both the business strategy and the creative element is probably not your direct descendant.
David: Right, probably not your nepotistic family member.
Ben: That's not the best search process to run, and yet it works. I don't think it's this magical bloodline. I think it is a deep understanding of the tradition of the business, of exactly what type of chutzpah the team has to rally and take on, having the political clout to find the right people, and empower them to make the change, to have a sixth sense for where you sit in the marketplace versus competitors and what people may want out of your brand next. It's all the intangibles that come from growing up in the business make you able to be the right person to transform it.
David: I really do think that there is an element too of the successive generations, they apprentice in the ateliers with their hands. I think there is an element of that. They also apprentice, especially these days on the business side too. Axel talks, all the time, about dinner table conversations between his uncle, Jean-Louis, who we're about to talk about now, who is the fifth generation CEO of Hermes and his mother, who was head of production at the dinner table growing up. You can't not absorb that.
I think that's the flip side of nepotism, which makes it such a challenging topic. On the one hand, obviously limiting the universe of talent. On the other hand, how do you replicate those dinner table conversations?
Ben: It's funny. I called it a sixth sense. I think the right way to describe it is actually a je ne sais quoi about what you absorb from those.
David: Totally. Okay, Jean-Louis, the fifth generation. The consultants are saying, hey, go be like Gucci.
Ben: Shut down your shop, where they still today make Birkin and Kelly bags by hand one artisan at a time in the most famous address in all of luxury and fashion. Not so.
David: I do have to correct you there. That is not specifically true. It's certainly spiritually true. I believe now, the only products that are made in the Faubourg are saddles. I think everything else is made in Pantin, which is a 20-minute drive away. It's not like the outsourced production. Anyway, we'll get to that.
Ben: Great.
David: Okay, Jean-Louis comes in.
Ben: What year is this?
David: 1978.
Ben: Great.
David: He, like all the generations before and after him, come up. He apprenticed in the business. He knows how to do the saddle stitch. It's in his hands, it's in his soul.
Ben: We've talked too many times without actually talking about the saddle stitch. It's time to actually talk about saddle stitching. Listeners, you might be wondering, why do they keep saying this? What does it mean? Saddle stitching is an amazing technique that Hermes uses for every single bag that they make. I can't tell if this is true or not. It can either only be done by hand, or until recently only be done by hand, but it is a far more effective, high quality, and durable form of stitching relative to the typical machine sewn stitching that you're thinking about right now, where the same thread goes through one needle and it goes up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down.
David: It's also incredibly beautiful. It's got a slight diagonal valence to it as opposed to the normal straight line stitching.
Ben: Yes. How does it work? There's something called a horse that goes between your legs. The horse holds two pieces of leather together. The whole point of the saddle stitch is to sew two pieces of leather together. You first punch little holes in the leather using likely a pricking iron as your method of doing this. If you're good, you don't prick all the way through. You just poke a little hole with your pricking iron or all part way through, so that way you don't poke too big of a hole. You only end up pushing exactly a hole the size of your needle and thread through.
You can always tell. If you're looking at something and it's stitched, there are these big freaking holes, then there's this thin thread that's moving through, and there's space between the thread and the leather, you know what kind of craftsmanship went into that. If it almost looks like the stitch vanishes into the leather and you're like, is there even a hole there, it's hard to even see how this was done, that is a saddle stitch. You take your pricking iron or your awl, you poke the partial hole. There's a lot of muscle memory involved in this. You then pass one needle through going from the right to the left side, and then you have a second needle...
David: On the other end of the thread, so one thread two needles.
Ben: Yes, that you pass through the other direction. What you've done as you pull both of them through is created this incredibly strong interlocking mechanism.
David: There's tensile force going in both directions.
Ben: Yes. If it gets ripped, you're not at risk of the whole thing pulling out, your saddle, or your bag falling apart. You just lose that one stitch, and that one stitch can be repaired. The only way for you to unravel something that is saddle stitched together is to individually go through and cut every single stitch.
David: Yeah, compare that to most products that you own.
Ben: Yes, this literally provides high utility if you're in an equestrian jumping competition or if your bag needs to hold something that really needs a lot of protection and can't fall through. It's almost like it started with real necessary utility, because something life threatening could happen. Now it's just massively overkill for everything that is saddle stitch, but you appreciate the craft behind it. There are very few people who are in a life or death circumstance that are dependent on their stitch holding true.
David: I'm going to channel my inner Pierre-Alexis here, the current artistic director of Hermès. I think it still has relevance if you want your object to be permanent. If you want an object that you own to represent something wholly different and antithetical to the Amazonification or the Walmartification of items these days, you want it to be made like this.
Ben: Yup. Something that made this really special for hundreds of years, if not still, is that it had to be done by hand. If you want something of this quality, this gets this interesting idea, is handmade stuff better? Not necessarily. Axel even says this in an interview. He says in 2019, today, hand stitching is the highest quality, so machines are non negotiable. When the quality of a machine stitching gets better than hand stitching, we will do it. We are not a museum.
David, this is where you're getting your, we are not a museum quote from. But it really gets to this element of, why are handcrafted goods desirable? In this case, it literally creates something higher quality, more durable, certainly more aesthetically pleasing, since when done well, you can't see that hole in between the thread and the leather. It's a pretty special process.
For everyone who's wondering, okay, but what is the rest of creating one of these bags look like, start to finish, a Kelly bag, and we'll talk about working in a little bit but similar story, is made by one craftsman. One craftsman starts with 36 unique pieces of high quality leather.
David: As much as possible from the same animal and matched exactly.
Ben: Yes, exactly. It's not sourced from all these different places all over the world, one person is responsible for the bottoms, and someone else is responsible for the straps. It is one craftsman that takes these 36 cuts and stitches it together. It takes 20 hours. This is over the course of a few weeks to create this. One person assembling it all, putting the fasteners on it, stitching it. This takes two years to learn how to do before you are allowed to create one for the first time.
David: I think it's even more than that. It's two years of training to become a Hermes artisan, period. I don't think you're allowed to touch the Birkins and the Kellys when you start day one on the job. I believe you need at least another three years, if not more, before you're allowed to touch the Birkins and the Kellys.
Ben: Fascinating. This knowledge is passed from generation to generation. Hermes refers to this as the savoir faire or the know how or the expertise about the materials and the exceptional technique that's transmitted from one craftsperson to another.
David: Hang on to this. I have a lot more to say when we get to the current generation about this.
Ben: I'll stop after this, but I thought this was pretty funny. Have you read the annual report, the 600-page document that they release once a year?
David: I have to admit, I have not read it cover to cover.
Ben: You did more of the history, and I did more of this.
David: But I've read large sections of it.
Ben: I was reading it. I found myself laughing at how often savoir faire was used in the prose. Every other paragraph, they just throw in a savoir faire, 133 times savoir faire is referenced in the Hermes registration document.
David: Partially in their defense, savoir faire literally translates as know how. It's a proper term in French.
Ben: Yeah, fair. I think the takeaway is real that this knowledge is transmitted from one generation to the other in the very same way that it was from father to son all the way back at the founding of the company. That is how they scale production. I will put a pin in that and come back to it later.
David: Yup. The true genius of the current generation is they have scaled that to 7000 people.
Ben: It's unbelievable.
David: Unbelievable. I was going to talk about this towards the end of the Jean-Louis era, but I want to say it now because I think it's perfect. I got to talk to a woman named Beatrice Amblard, who lives here in San Francisco.
This is amazing. She was an artisan at Hermes in Paris. She was hired right at the start of Jean-Louis's tenure. She worked in the atelier at the Faubourg when Jean-Louis's son, Pierre-Alexis, current artistic director, came to train after school as a teenager. He sat next to Beatrice, and I got to chat with her about this.
Ben: She runs April in Paris in San Francisco?
David: She moved to San Francisco when Hermes opened the San Francisco store here. I was like, oh, you transitioned to the front of the house. She was like, no, no, no. I was the person for the West Coast who repaired everything for North American West Coast clients. There was one person in New York, and I was in San Francisco. We came from the Faubourg, and a few of these people go around the world.
One of the things about Hermes and actually Jean-Louis who said that the true essence of luxury and the true essence of Hermes is everything they make can be repaired. If you buy an item from Hermes, no matter what it is, they will repair it.
Ben: Yeah, I think that's true.
David: Even if it's 100 years old, you bring it in, they will repair it.
Ben: Yeah, that's true. This is flashing forward to today, 15 dedicated repair shops worldwide, and they mend 120,000 pieces a year.
David: Wow, amazing. I asked Beatrice when I was talking to her, what was this like? What was special? She said, look, you have to understand, when I was training as a young person and decided I wanted to go into this field, Hermes was absolutely the greatest company that anyone could hope to work for. It wasn't even close. There was no comparison.
Ben: What years?
David: This was in the late 80s, early 90s. She said, look, I decided that either I was going to get a job at Hermes, or I was going to leave this industry and go do something else. It is in that high of a steam. I said, oh, well, why? She said, look, by the time we're at this era, nobody else was left that did this.
Everything we talked about in the 1970s, all these other brands all went in this complete other direction. The consultants were telling Hermes to go in that direction too, but they're the last one standing that did all of this by hand in the tradition handed down through hundreds of years. If that's important to you, there's no place else. You can't ply your trade doing that anywhere else.
I asked her then. I was like, okay, well, as for the products and to the clients, to the customers, why does that make a difference? What she said is what you'll hear the family talk about all the time. She said, look, it's about soul. This product has a soul. Somebody made that thing with their bare hands. That means something. There's nobody else, certainly at Hermes at scale, that does that.
She ended up leaving Hermes and starting her own boutique here in San Francisco, April in Paris, and she actually also runs her own leather school here in San Francisco too to train artisans. You can get custom stuff, small boutique stuff. Beatrice is a worldwide master, you can get that from her. But the idea that a $200 billion company at scale would be doing this. There's nobody else.
Ben: Yeah, it's nuts. It's completely insane. The people who don't work for Hermes, your options are in the dozens. If you go as a customer and you want something like a saddle stitched bag, wallet, or something like Hermes would make in that traditional pre war, early 20th century fashion, there aren't that many other artisans out there. Hermes employs 7000 of them. I don't know how many other ones there are, 1000, 2000.
It's not like Hermes has cornered the market. They're hiring more people and training them as fast as they can. They're trying to preserve this market that otherwise would have entirely been zero. It's a pretty crazy thing that they've managed to scale even to the scale that they're at.
David: The other thing Beatrice said to bring it back to Jean-Louis, he is a legend. He really cared. The idea that he would follow the consultants, it was just so completely anathema to him. He's the artistic director and CEO of the company. She ran into him in the elevator in the Faubourg right after she started. He looks at her and said, you're Beatrice Amblard, welcome to Hermes. He knew everybody by name.
When she ended up leaving in 1997 to open her own store, he called her. He was genuinely shocked. Nobody ever leaves. What are you going to do? She explained that she wanted to be entrepreneurial, start her own thing. Shortly after the San Francisco Chronicle did an article about her, he found the article, read it in France, cut it out, and mailed it to her with a note of congratulations handwritten.
Ben: It doesn't cost me anything to do that. On the one hand, you just say they're being a kind person and gave so much to your house for so long.
David: On the other hand, this is the CEO of Hermes.
Ben: Right. I think it's important to realize, these individual craftsmen are entirely non competitive with Hermes. It's a completely different value proposition to the customer. When you're buying Hermes today, you don't start from a place of, you know, I think I want some of the very best sewn leather goods I can find. Let me evaluate the whole landscape of people who could deliver that for me, and then I'll decide which maker to go with.
Either A, you're doing that, and you are a person who knows about a bunch of individual leather craftsmen, which is rare. Or B, you actually just want to buy something from Hermes, and there's not any evaluation going on. Maybe there is between big luxury brands, but probably not, the value proposition is not you have a need for a leather good, and you can bake off all the competitors. It's you either want something from Hermes, or you're a different type of customer.
David: Yup. Okay, Jean-Louis story. How did he turn this thing around and save Hermes from the consultants? Like we said, he'd apprenticed just like every other generation. But unlike any other generation, or I guess maybe like Emile back in the day going and meeting Henry Ford, he comes to America. Specifically, he came to America to follow his wife, Rena, who became a world famous architect. Rena was interning with IM Pei in New York.
Ben: Really?
David: Rena Dumas would go on to design all the stores that they opened up all around the world and design the atelier in Pantin when they expand production.
Ben: IM Pei, famous from a number of things, including previous acquired episode with Michael Ovitz, designed the CAA building in Los Angeles designed the Louvre Pyramid.
David: I was going to say. Think about the connections here in France and Paris.
Ben: Yeah. By the way, everyone in Paris thought the pyramid was hideously ugly at first relative to this 1700s building around it. Over time now, it's become this iconic triangle pyramid, beautiful signature of the city.
David: Yeah. Jean-Louis, when he's in America, he works for Bloomingdale's. Bloomingdale's, my god, of all places.
Ben: There was a heyday of department stores. In fact, if you go way back, do you know how Hermes entered the United States?
David: In partnership with Neiman Marcus?
Ben: Yes, 1930s. Good. Wow, you did find that.
David: It's hard to stop me, but you do it sometimes.
Ben: Okay, Bloomingdale's.
David: From that experience being in America, being in this much more mainstream audience, he comes to understand what these other brands are doing, what the consultants are suggesting, but he takes that back. He says, look, the way forward is we're going to figure out how to make Hermes relevant. We're not going to throw away everything we've done. We're going to keep our tradition, we're going to keep our craftsmanship, we're going to keep our market position. But our clients want to be like these young people, particularly these young women. The moms don't want to be like their moms, they want to be like their daughters.
Ben: It's a tall order to figure out how to revitalize, rejuvenate, and make Hermes relevant for this new era with this new audience.
David: With the same products. This is key.
Ben: Right. Keeping the same products and not violating everything that Hermes currently stands for. We talked about this on LVMH, the Not Your Mother's Tiffany campaign. It's almost like, how do you not insult your current customer base by adapting for the next one?
David: This is such a tight needle to thread to use a pun here. They need to run the Not Your Mother's Tiffany campaign without actually running the Not Your Mother's Tiffany campaign.
Ben: Right.
David: The first thing, in 1979, the first year he takes over, he launches a new ad campaign in Paris with young Parisian women wearing the iconic Hermes scarves. Remember, that's the main part of the business at this point in time, but it's all these old people who want to be like Queen Elizabeth wearing the scarves. Young women wearing the scarves, not how you would typically wear a scarf, different parts all over their body. It's the Hermes version of Not Your Mother's Tiffany.
Most importantly, they're wearing these scarves with jeans. Grace Kelly would never wear jeans. I don't know if she ever did wear jeans, but she sure as hell wouldn't be photographed wearing jeans.
Ben: Fascinating.
David: These ads are the scarves the Queen Elizabeth is wearing with jeans and in fun, interesting ways, playful ways to wear the scarves, but they're still the same scarves.
Ben: Fascinating.
David: This is a revolution. The rest of the family is really upset about it, but he pushes it through. You can still see echoes of this to this day. A big part of Hermes fashion and probably the biggest part of I think the scarf fashion these days is tying the scarves on your bags, on your accessories, on various parts of your body. Not wearing them like your mother wore them.
Ben: This is how they've adapted for the digital era too. They've come out with five or six different apps to try to figure out how we engage people in the mobile era. One of the ideas that they had was this app that basically gives you suggestions and all the different ways you could tie a scarf.
David: That's super cool. I think this is brilliant, because this is allowing Hermes to exist and be relevant alongside fashion without actually getting into fashion themselves. The scarves and then ultimately the bags, can be the accessories to your jeans, to your fashion to your—we're past the era of bell bottoms. but the spiritual equivalent of bell bottoms here. They can say something about you, but they're still the same products that they always were.
Ben: It's pretty interesting if you can figure out how to coexist alongside cool, fashionable new cutting edge things. Then you deserve a place in someone's lineup where they say, well, I both am embracing a current trend, but I'm also respectful of the past. I also found my own way to weave this high class, high status thing into the rest of my image. I think that especially at their price points, they're serving someone who wants to raise one hand and say, I look cool and raise the other hand and say...
David: I'm classic.
Ben: I'm classic, and I have the money to spend on things that are very price anchored. Everyone knows what a Kelly bag costs. It's gone up a little bit, but Hermes has very high price point products that stay approximately that price forever.
David: Jean-Louis has a quote about this, which is very French. He says, "The young customers came to us more than we went to them. People saw again, but with a new eye, the beauty of materials worked by fine hands. They came, we followed." That's the most French way of ever saying this, but this is what we're talking about. He got their client base and often the young people's parents who wanted to be more like the young people here to see with new eyes the same things. Total genius.
Ben: Yup, for sure. Okay, that's brilliant.
David: That's on the product side and doing this jiu jitsu to reposition the products in Hermes. The other thing that he did, which was huge was he had the very same realization that Henry Racamier had at Louis Vuitton, and we foreshadowed this earlier. What Racamier figured out at Louis Vuitton in the 1970s was that the market now, the global wealthy, the global elite, the global rich, is so much bigger now than it was in the 1950s. The number of people with wealth on the order of Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier of Monaco, or even a few rungs below them, but the number of people who can be in our client base around the world is just so, so, so much larger than it used to be.
Ben: And it's happening in this country by country way, which is perfect for a brand like this. They can go to America, and then they will observe the rise of Japan, and then they'll go to japan in the 90s and 2000s. Then they'll observe the rising upper middle class of China, so they'll go there and present day. They can really position themselves as the second mover, where they can watch and see when this wealth class exists somewhere, then set up shop, and say, hey, France's whole heritage is now available to you to adopt as part of your persona.
David: Yeah, and this is super key. I think to this day, it's a huge part of the defensibility of Hermes and Louis Vuitton too. No matter where you live in the world and no matter what your cultural background is, when you attain this status, there's still something about this connection to French and European nobility that you cannot buy from a brand from any other country.
Ben: It's super fascinating that French nobility, fashion, and heritage is universally revered everywhere. Italian is too. I would say European generally, but French specifically, has an ability to do this in any geography as it develops.
David: Yup. All of this stew comes together in 1984 with Jean-Louis's greatest achievement. Unlike the Kelly bag, which again was an accident, yes, it was his father Robert and incredible genius, and then repositioning and renaming the bag, the Kelly bag. Jean Louis, this is literally whole cloth conceived of by him, was on a flight from Paris to London in the early 1980s, where he's seated next to the French and British actress, Jane Birkin.
Ben: The It Girl of the time.
David: Here's what's really interesting. I bet 95% plus of people listening to this right now have no idea who Jane Birkin was.
Ben: Which is so funny because in interviews with her, as the Birkin bag was blowing up or at least getting a lot of attention, an interviewer joked that she was going to be more famous for the bag than for her acting career, her modeling, and all that. She laughed and said, wouldn't that be something?
David: Yeah, right.
Ben: Totally, 95%, if not more of the listeners to this podcast will have no idea who Jane Birkin is before this episode.
David: But you definitely know the Birkin bag.
Ben: Yup, or at least you know of the Birkin bag. I'd bet 7 out of 10, maybe 8 out of 10 people listening to this couldn't spot it. But if you say a Birkin bag, you know that it's unattainably expensive, high status, hard to get handbag.
David: Certainly if you follow the Hermes stock, you know what a Birkin bag is, even if you probably couldn't pick it out of a crowd.
Ben: Yes.
David: Anyway, this is the culmination of everything we've been talking about. Who is Jane Birkin? She was British. She was born in England, but she moved to France and became a French citizen, and she became a French cultural icon. Again, the tie to France is so important here too.
We didn't talk about this with Grace Kelly either. Grace Kelly was an American from Philadelphia, but she became the princess of Monaco. These two women, these two personas that are embodied in Hermes, Hermes doesn't do celebrity advertising. I think it's so important that even though neither of them were French, they became so deeply European and what they represented.
Ben: Yeah, that's a great way to put it.
David: For Jane Birkin, she was this next generation. She was an actress, both in film and theater. She was a singer. She was incredibly beautiful. She was the It girl, but in a very, very different way than Grace Kelly, she wore jeans. In particular, she had a trademark accessory fitting with the 1970s.
Ben: The basket?
David: Yup. Counterculture, back to the land type ethos. She carried a wicker basket with her everywhere that she went.
Ben: Which has an ethos to it, but doesn't lend itself well to overhead bins.
David: No, it does not. As the two of them, Jean-Louis, CEO and Artistic Director of Hermès and Jane Birkin, French cultural icon, are boarding this flight to London, they're seated next to each other, and Jane is struggling to get her fixed handle wicker basket up into the overhead compartment. At this point, Jane had become a mother and had kids. She had kid stuff in her basket.
Ben: She had baby bottles that were spilling out.
David: Totally. I carry a lot of kid stuff these days. You need a lot of stuff with the kids.
Ben: By the way, how crazy is it that the Kelly bag was to hide a pregnancy, and the Birkin bag was designed to carry baby bottles?
David: Baby forward, yes. I get it. On the one hand, this is esoteric Birkin lore. On the other hand, I think this is super important to Jean-Louis. Imagine the older generation Hermes embracing this.
Ben: You know what we should do? We should come out with a $15,000 diaper bag.
David: Right. They sit down and they start talking on the flight. Jean-Louis introduces himself. He's like, I noticed you're struggling with your wicker basket there Miss Birkin.
Ben: And she doesn't know who he is at first. It's the funniest thing.
David: Right.
Ben: She says something like, well, yeah, wouldn't that be great if there was a bigger bag that actually closed? But Hermes doesn't make that, or she made some comment. He goes, I am Hermes.
David: Yeah. The legend now. Who knows if this is true? She said, well, when Hermes makes a diaper bag, I'll use that one.
Ben: Specifically for her, she fancies herself someone that has a lot of stuff and wants to bring all my stuff with me, so I just need a big bag, and it needs to close easily. Fashion be damned, I just need a huge freaking tote.
David: Yup. As they get to talking, they're talking about the Kelly. She's like, look, Kelly's the Kelly, but I can't wear it over my shoulder. Jean-Louis starts sketching out designs on the plane, and voila. The Birkin is born.
Larger than the Kelly, but smaller than the old original Hermès bag. It's a tote bag, and it has two handles unlike the Kelly, which has one handle, and so with two handles. You can put it over your shoulder. It's the—it feels weird to say more casual version of the Kelly, given that it's the Birkin bag, but it is. It's the more casual modern version of the Kelly.
Ben: The Kelly has cleaner lines and this beautiful, almost mid century trapezoidal shape, whereas the Birkin, everything about it screams function.
David: Here's what's interesting. They released the product in 1984, and it is not an immediate success. I think part of this is that the Hermes brand transformation modernization was probably still underway. When you watch interviews with particularly, Pierre-Alexis, he'll talk about this. He's like, any other company would have given up on this product. But it takes about five years before the Birkin bag becomes the Birkin bag. The time is right. We're in the 1980s, the go-go years. These are the years that are shaping Bernard Arnault here.
Ben: There are tons of American wealth being created. People are looking to be a little bit flashier. Now, granted Hermes is the least flashy of the luxury labels you could adopt, but people know the brand.
David: Yeah. It takes five years for it to become any modicum of success for Hermès. A lot of these things, this just slow burn starts that grows, and grows, and grows, and grows.
Ben: There's a real lore around it that it's hard to get. It's just like with a kid. If you tell them they can't have something, they wanted a lot more. If you tell your very fancy clientele that you would love to be able to get something for them, there's just not enough.
We don't have it today, but gosh, if you are a great customer of ours and we maintain a relationship with you, let me write down your number. I feel like we may just have something for you soon. It could be a few years, but I'll reach out as soon as we have something. You're an important customer of ours. If you want to show us you're an even more important customer, please do by all means. And I'll see what I can do.
David: Ben, you would make a great Hermes essay.
Ben: I don't think so. I actually had a wonderful Hermes associate that I worked with in the Aix-en-Provence store. It was crazy. We bought basically the most entry level Hermes products that you can buy in one of their stores. I think perfumes are sold in department stores and makeup. There are some more accessible things, but in terms of the durable goods, it started at the bottom.
I had a delightful time and decided to buy something. I think we spent an hour and a half, and I had the most wonderful service and built an almost friendship with the associate who helped us through the whole process, spending as much time with me as they spent with someone coming in to pick up their Birkin bag. It was crazy, probably the best customer service I've ever received in any retail establishment anywhere. No, I don't think I would be a good Hermes sales associate relative to where the bar has been set.
David: It's funny. My experience was different. Of course, I had to go do some research for this episode.
Ben: You drove down to the Palo Alto store, right?
David: Yes, I went to the Palo Alto store. I had to be down there anyway for some meetings. The sales associate who ultimately helped me is equally wonderful woman. I had a great experience. Her name is Susan. I'm going back to see her tomorrow as Valentine's Day and Jenny's birthday is coming up. I walked in the store with the intention of buying what I ultimately did buy, which is...
Ben: Apple watch band. I thought that's what that was.
David: An Apple watch band, yup. We'll get to the Apple partnership in a little bit. I was passed around between a few different people in the store until ultimately, Susan helped me out. She was great. I think she actually might be a higher level essay. But when I expressed that I was there to buy an Apple Watch, Ben...
Ben: Interesting.
David: Yeah. I don't know if that was just the day in the store or if that is part of the policy.
Ben: I have to imagine it's a little bit different experience in the French countryside as compared to...
David: The Stanford shopping center.
Ben: Yeah, I can see that. Back to the Birkin bag, by 2001, it becomes so widely known that there is a waiting list, an almost secret shrouded in mystery waiting list to get one of these things, that it is the main storyline of a Sex and the City episode. Samantha figures out that there's a way to jump the five-year waitlist.
David: The scene where she walks in to try and buy it is just iconic, where the sales associate is responding to her like, it's $12,000 or whatever. Like oh, I know. There's a waiting list, of course.
Ben: She name drops one of her celebrity clients and In order to say, it's actually for them to try to move up the waitlist. Calamity ensues, they actually figure out that it's for her, not the client. I actually haven't watched the episode, but this is a cultural touchstone for the Birkin going from something that is whispered about in handbag circles and well-known by the wealthy elite to something that is now a very well known phenomena, which is good luck ever getting a Birkin bag and the crazy stories about the most expensive one ever selling for $500,000 on the secondary market, and Victoria Beckham having a collection of over a hundred. It's crazy. It has become the Patek Philippe Nautilus of handbags, and people look at it almost as an investment.
David: A way of summing up what you're saying is the hard thing about buying a Birkin is not coming up with the money.
Ben: Which is crazy. It's starting at $12,000 handbag. What you're saying is that's actually not the constraint.
David: Yup. But also what you're talking about, with echoes of our Nike episode here, the minute that you are in possession of a Birkin bag, you could immediately sell it for a lot more than what you paid for it.
Ben: And your Hermes essay will not be very happy that you did that, because the point of buying one is to own one, use one, and appreciate the craft, the work, and the beauty that went into this product. Hermes is not trying to sell it to people that are going to flip it. They're trying to sell it to valued customers who will be people who appreciate the Hermes dream for the rest of their life.
David: Yeah. That would be the last Birkin bag that you'll ever buy. Every bag, I think maybe even every item that Hermes makes, has what Hermes calls a blind stamp on it. This is a series of symbols and numbers.
Ben: There's one on my belt right now.
David: Yup, and some on my watch band right now, that are stamped into the leather that uniquely identify that item, the year it was made, and the craftsperson who made it.
Ben: There are some very cool stories of people who are transitioning from a crafts person who makes goods to repairs them later in their career and who receive an item back for repair, where they were the original creator of that handbag. That is the coolest, craziest, full circle Hermes moment for any Hermes craftsperson to see. This thing that I made that I really wanted to be durable and stand up in the world. How did it actually perform? To get it back 10, 20 years later and see it has got to be crazy cool.
David: Yes.
Ben: Today, everything we're talking about here, the Birkin bag, the Kelly bag, these $10,000-$100,000 retail handbags, depending on the type of exotic leather and everything, and the scarcity are referred to as a category of Veblen goods. This is essentially the opposite of everything you learned in econ 101.
David: As is everything about this company.
Ben: Yes. Normally, price is where supply meets demand. As the price of a good increases, demand for it would go down. A Veblen good is the opposite. As price increases, people actually want it more. Price ends up being a signal that the item is desirable, and thus it stimulates demand now.
Interestingly, David, this is exactly what you were talking about before. Birkin bags sell below the market clearing price. That is another defiance of microeconomics. Normally, things should Be priced exactly at the intersection of supply meeting demand.
David: I was just laughing as you're talking about Veblen goods there. I whipped out my copy of The Luxury Strategy and flipped to anti-law of marketing number 13, raise your prices as time goes on in order to increase demand.
Ben: It's so interesting. But one way to look at this is, oh, it's lost revenue. Their prices aren't high enough because they can only make so many of them, and they're selling them below the price people are willing to pay, so there's money left on the table. Another way to look at it is that it's an investment in the brand.
There's a very good Substack writer, 310 value, that will link to in the show notes, who observed the supply demand mismatch creates scarcity in these two bags That scarcity likely creates more demand for the bags, elevates the overall status of Hermes, and creates demand for Hermes' other products, as customers buy Hermes's other goods to build a relationship with the company in hopes of being allocated a bag at the below market retail price.
David: Yes. This is the same dynamic with I think a very different set of motivations as we talked about on the Nike episode. I very firmly believe that Nike could sell many of their shoes for two, three, four, or five times the price that they do. They'll show up on Goat or StockX all the time regularly at higher prices than Nike releases them for. I believe that the reason that they do this is to maintain goodwill with their customer base and maintain Nike's image as a brand that is accessible to everyone.
Hermes is doing the opposite. They want this to happen in order to maintain the image of Hermes, specifically the Birkins and the Kellys, as a brand and a product that is not accessible to everyone.
Ben: Yes. It's not as simple as, well, they just keep raising the prices to make people keep wanting them more. You read that in The Luxury Strategy, and many luxury brands do that. In fact, Chanel has done it in record amounts the last couple of years. I think it's called the Chanel classic flap medium or something like that. That's had this crazy appreciation over the last few years where Chanel is just raising the price. Hermes doesn't do that.
David: We'll talk about this more later in the episode. By my very back of the envelope calculations, they are raising their prices on average across the entire line, 7% per year for the last 10 years.
Ben: So it's like 4% or 5% above inflation?
David: Yup, which is more, but not an egregious amount.
Ben: Right. There was a study that found that the Birkin 30, which is one of the sizes in Togo leather didn't even equal the rate of inflation in the US. I'm trying to figure out what the motivation here is because it's a tremendous restraint. There's no cash grab happening. Maybe it's because, what bad things would happen to Hermes if they decided, you know what, Birkins are 20 now, not 12?
David: Right. They're already viewed as the most expensive handbags in the world. What harm done to go from 12 to 20?
Ben: Right. They sell a lot of them, so that actually would be a lot of profit dollars.
David: Right. For somebody who's going to spend 12,000 on a handbag, are that many more of those people going to be price sensitive at that swing from 12 to 20? Probably not.
Ben: Right. The Wall Street Journal estimated in 2020 that there's about 120,000 of the combined Birkin and Kelly created each year, so 120,000 bags a year. If you decide that you want to make another 8000 of pure profit on each bag, that is tempting. I think it actually says a lot about Hermes' obsession with conservatism that they don't meaningfully increase the price.
The Kelly is not far above its original 1950s price, inflation adjusted. I think the Birkin bag, the retail price was around $2000 when it launched in 1984, so call it maybe 6000 inflation adjusted. You're looking at maybe twice the price that it launched out on an inflation adjusted basis.
I guess the point I'm making here is, I think we should keep in the back of our mind the rest of the episode this question of, why doesn't Hermes raise the prices? They're already getting the benefit either way of the trickle down of people participating in the Hermes ecosystem to hopefully get the call one day. Why not make it even more expensive when you do get the call?
David: Interesting. All right, let's come back to that later in the episode.
Ben: Yeah. Okay, 1984, Birkin release, doesn't sell well for the first five years, then it becomes this cultural touchstone and gain steam every year after that.
David: I was just thinking about that as we were chatting here. This makes sense to me that it wouldn't be a hit right away. Because it takes time to build the lore and aura around this bag, you can't just drop a new product and have it become this immediately in this category.
Ben: Correct.
David: You're never going to have like an iPhone of luxury handbags.
Ben: Correct. It has to be like a Taylor Swift concert. Actually, I think it's a reasonable comp that her concert was extremely scarce, brand new product, priced at an extreme premium. That did sell right away, because the product had so much of the brand in it, like you knew exactly what you were going to get from going to the Taylor concert because you're extremely familiar with the brand. But it's not necessarily well understood that the Birkin equals Hermes in the way that The Eras Tour equals Taylor Swift.
David: Totally. It's also that the product was The Eras Tour, the product was not Midnights. If it were like, oh, I'm going to go to Taylor's concert and listen to her play all the songs on the new album, of course a lot of people would still go. But it was like, no, I'm going to go to Taylor's concert and hear all of Taylor.
Ben: All the amazing Hermes scarves from over the years released out of the vault.
David: Yes, the Disney plus of Taylor. All right, different episode here. Okay, back to Jean-Louis. This is how he does it. He does two incredible things to save the company. (1) He repositions the prem. I can't believe he pulled this off. He pulls off Not Your Mother's Tiffany without saying Not Your Mother's Tiffany, and the culmination of that is the Birkin bag and everything that that represents. (2) The internationalization, discovering, and running the same playbook that Racamier ran at Louis Vuitton.
By the end of Jean-Louis' tenure in 2006, a couple of years after the famous Sex in the City episode, Hermes has gone from well less than a hundred million dollars when he took over. The consultants were saying, outsource, shut it down, essentially. By the end of the decade of the 80s, he was just under half a billion dollars in revenue. In 2006, he's taken it to $2 billion in annual revenue. From nice family business to this is a real, real thing.
Ben: One more time on those numbers.
David: I don't know the exact revenue figure when he took over, but let's call it $50 million in annual revenue. We know it was well less than a hundred to 42 billion when he retires in 2006.
Ben: So 40x in 30 years?
David: Yeah, 40x in under 30 years.
Ben: Wow.
David: Pretty good. Pretty transformative for the family business. Along the way, as the company clearly becomes more and more valuable, remember, he is the family member who's running it, but we're now on the fifth generation of the family. We're starting to bleed into the sixth generation of the family. They're now over 80 family members out there. Many of whom are involved in the business, but many of whom aren't. Now this business that they all own is doing $2 billion a year in revenue at very, very high margins. There starts to be some demand for liquidity here.
Ben: Right. Every single one of those family members, most valuable asset and their entire net worth is their privately held Hermes stock that nobody can really put a price tag on. It's just sitting there in everyone's mind of like, it sure would be easier to live my life if I knew that this 90% of my net worth actually worth something that I could access and an even split. That's $25 million a person. I'm pretty sure it's the most valuable thing that any of them owns.
David: Right. In 1993, Jean-Louis lists Hermes on the Paris Stock Exchange. Collectively, when the dust settles, the family has sold 19% of Hermes to the public. They still own 81%. Now, the public float grows a little bit over the years. As more family members sell, more generational transfer happens. More or less still, 70% plus family owned and controlled. It would really take some sort of absolute financial genius to come in and even consider. We owned over 70% of this business, we're unassailable. Who on earth could possibly make a run at our company?
Ben: It would take a real wolf, I'll tell you.
David: This has been so fun. I've had so much fun with this episode. All this history, I just revel in the French connection and everything. This is Hermes' finest moment that we're about to talk about here, through it all.
Ben: It's interesting, it's not their product.
David: No. It has nothing to do with the product. The fight with Bernard Arnault.
Ben: David Rosenthal, us return to Bernard Arnault. It's been 12 months.
David: It's been too long.
Ben: I've been wanting to hear the other side of the story.
David: I know. Okay, for anybody who's listened to our LVMH episode, as we talked about earlier, the climax of the story is Bernard's fight with Gucci in that episode. Gucci is the one that gets away, Bernard isn't able to buy it. Right after the Gucci fight ends in the early 2000s, the same story plays out with Hermes.
I think really in an even more dramatic fashion, in 2001, right after he lost Gucci, Bernard quietly buys an initial stake in Hermes of 4.9%. I believe that was just under the threshold that they would have to disclose it under French securities, regulations.
Here's what they do that the Hermes families couldn't see coming that only Bernard could engineer. He continues buying for the next 10 years using equity swap derivatives. It looks like other entities are buying these shares on the open markets, but LVMH have the rights to exercise options to actually take those shares. This is really hard to remember. I had to triple check these numbers. At this point in time, Hermes' market cap is below $20 billion.
Ben: That's 8%-9% of what it is today.
David: When Bernard first starts buying in the early 2000s, it's below $10 billion. You could say lots of things about Bernard and genius should be top of your list, but he is one of the best investors of all time. To identify Hermes at this point in time, and as we will see, he makes a Incredible amount of money on these trades, today, Hermes is a $230 billion market cap company, and he starts buying at below $10 billion.
Ben: Which is interesting. You say he spotted Hermes. It wasn't hard to spot. The interesting thing is not that he realized it was the crown jewel of luxury, it was that he realized that the crown jewel of luxury could be worth 20-30 times as much as it was already worth.
David: He starts buying Hermes shares. Axel, I think, jokes about this in an interview. He's like, look, Bernard isn't buying your shares just because he wants to make an investment or he wants to have some fun. Obviously, he wants to own Hermes.
Ben: By the way, when David and I are referencing these Axel interviews, it's one interview. He made a random appearance here and there, but he has done one long form, on stage interview, and it is fantastic.
David: Yes, it's great. We'll link to it in the sources. You should go watch it. Why is Bernard doing this? Obviously, on the one hand, he sees the value here. For God's sakes, that Sex in the City episode was just dedicated to the Birkin. There's a lot of value to be unlocked here, shall we say, in owning Hermes. But it's not just that.
I hope on our LVMH episode, this is some of the nuance that we painted about Bernard. He's not just a corporate raider. He actually is an operator. He is one of, if not the best luxury operator out there. He sees two things in Hermes that maybe aren't as obvious to the rest of the world and that he thinks actually are going to create an opportunity for him.
(1) Generational transfer is about to happen. Jean-Louis can't live forever. It's not immediately clear who the next successor is going to be. Jean-Louis's son, Pierre-Alexis, takes over as artistic director. Pierre-Alexis went to America for college. He went to Brown University.
Interesting. In an interview, I found this. He initially wanted to study computer science at Brown, but he switched to art history, very fitting. He comes in and he joins Hermes right after graduation in 1992. He's being groomed, but Jean-Louis wants to separate out the artistic director role and the CEO role.
Ben: They had been coupled before?
David: Yeah, he held both. Robert held both. Emile was both, Thierry was certainly both.
Ben: Right. That really illustrates the point you were making earlier that the creative and the business sides of the house are one side of the house.
David: Yes. Until this generation, it was one person. There was no separation at all. Pierre-Alexis is clearly the artistic heir. There's not a clear CEO heir. In fact, Jean Louis' choice, Axel, who ultimately does become CEO, he's not in the business yet.
Ben: Right. He did that internship, his five year apprenticeship, but then he left, right?
David: Yes. The story is that Axel really wanted to go work in China. He goes into investment banking after undergrad. He goes to Sciences Po. Remember, Jean-Louis was his uncle, but his mother who actually was not a family member was the managing director for production for Hermes. Axel has this dinner table trading in addition to the apprenticeship craftsman trading, but he goes off into the investment banking world. He works first in China and then in New York for BNP Paribas.
Ben: Wow. He is an expert in corporate structure, and he's an expert on this pretty interesting luxury market in the next 20 years China.
David: Yup, and America too. But he doesn't join the business until 2003 when Jean-Louis taps him. Again, on the one hand, as we've talked about, this is a nepotistic business, on the other hand, they're not going to just give him the CEO title right away. He needs to come pay his dues. He starts in the finance department in 2003. Then in 2006, when Jean Louis retires, Axel takes over running the Jewelry métier as CEO of Jewelry.
Ben: Listeners, you should know, jewelry is not an important part of the Hermes business. It's one of the 16 métiers. They don't even break it out in earnings. It probably rolls up under other Hermes sectors, because I don't think it's under watches, and I don't think it's under ready to wear accessories. All of other is 12%, so I'm going to guess this thing is 1% to 3%.
David: He does that for two years. In 2008, he goes and takes over the leather goods and saddlery business, the big one.
Ben: That's 43% of the business, and I think at the time it was closer to 50%.
David: Yes. Bernard sees, okay, we've got a generational transfer opening here. In fact, when Jean-Louis retires in 2006, he promotes his COO right hand person, Patrick Thomas, to be the first non family member CEO running the business side of the house alongside Pierre-Alexis on the artistic side.
Ben: At least In retrospect, they try to make this seem like not a big deal that a non family member took over as CEO. They billed it as, well, they needed someone to look after the business in the interim period before the family was ready to have the next heir.
David: I think there's as much chance as not that that was right, but at a minimum, I think this shows the ignorance. I don't want to say lackadaisicalness of the family here because it's certainly not that, but maybe ignorance or naivete that, hey, you're now a public company, and there are people like Bernard Arnault out there. You can't just be like, oh, yeah, we're going to do public company CEO transition in this way and take our time. You can, but you're opening the door for the Arnaults of the world. That's one thing that Bernard sees.
The other, and I really think this is a testament to his vision, despite all of the strength within Hermes and everything that Jean-Louis did, they actually are showing some cracks. This we had to piece together a little bit and talking to folks in the industry helped us out here. There's no questioning Hermes's financial results and on-the-surface brand value at this point in time in the 2000s, early 2010s, but there are a few things that are just starting to slip as they scale. I think, actually, the best story that illustrates this is one that the family members themselves do not tell but that you'll hear out there in the lore about Hermes, which is that I believe it was in Japan, they had a product, a bag.
Ben: Yeah. This is so interesting, listeners. If you listen to other coverage of Hermes, you will hear this story.
David: You never hear it from the perspective that we're about to tell it. Okay, here's how the story goes. Call it the late 2000s, early 2010s. Hermes is selling a canvas beach bag in Japan, and it is flying off the shelves, selling like hotcakes. It's like an equivalent of $150 canvas tote bag beach bag. This obviously gets the attention of management and the company that this is happening.
They decide that they are going in true Hermes fashion. Because it is selling so well, they are going to not only stop selling the product. They're going to take all their supply of it and destroy it. They come into a board meeting with all the family members. The management announced this, and it is met with a standing ovation from the family. This is upholding what Hermes is, which is we don't sell beach bags.
Ben: The family and the board is so aligned that no one even asked a question about this, they just stood and gave applause. Here's how this went on a meta level listeners. I heard this story, David heard this story. David texted me at one point and was like, isn't this an odd story? I was like, what do you mean? We realized, oh, this is not ever told by any of the family members or company executives anywhere. It's just out there, and the company is not secretive.
David: They love telling these legendary Hermes stories.
Ben: Yeah, and they've got a 600-page document they release once every year that clearly lays out their entire strategy. They produce documentaries interviewing their artisans, showing videos of their factories. It rings a little bit odd. It's like, okay, well, why are they not telling this story given how often it's bandied about?
David: Then you think about it a little bit and you're like, wait a minute, why the F did this happen in the first place?
Ben: Exactly. A canvas beach bag in Japan?
David: For $150?
Ben: And they're making enough of it that it's flying off the shelves? What company is this?
David: How on earth did this happen? This story here is not a heroic one of we destroyed the supply. This is a tragic one.
Ben: It's almost like when I was sitting there watching Wonder Woman 84. I was just so appalled at what I was watching that on this meta level, it occurred to me like, the story here isn't the plot of this movie. The story here is, how do you have such a process failure at Warner Brothers where this thing was let out the door? That is a failure of creative leadership, and that is what you have going on with a $150 canvas tote bag after 175 years of successful Hermes brand stewardship.
David:  Right, and building up the Birkin and the Kelly. For God's sakes, the scarves sell for $500. That I think is the most visceral illustration of this. Two other things that I saw in the research and I think Bernard probably saw here, too. Towards the end of Jean-Louis tenure, he and Hermes started buying and investing in other companies. But why is Hermes doing this?
Ben: Right. This is the weird stuff going on at Nike when they were buying Converse was the good example, but Starter. It was almost like they didn't realize, oh, we should be concentrating our firepower behind our one hero brand that they were trying to create the constellation of weak brands.
David: The best Hermes could ever hope for by doing this is they're going to be a subscale. They're not even going to be a Richemont and Kerin.
Ben: One argument, bootmaker John Lobb and all these other companies that they either bought in whole or in part, it became important for them to own their key supplier relationships.
David: Yes, those I think were probably strategic acquisitions.
Ben: Yeah, especially in watches where they actually fairly 25% position in the company that makes the movements to make sure that they have enough supply coming to them. That wasn't all of what they were doing. They were also buying other brands.
David: Yeah. Did you find the biggest disaster? This is in your wheelhouse.
Ben: I don't know.
David: I was wondering if I could stump you with this. They bought, I believe a 30%-35%. They were the largest shareholder in a German company that makes what is really a piece of technology, an old piece of technology, but not something that should be a luxury brand. This is very much in the performance end of the spectrum. They became the largest shareholders in Leica, the camera company.
Ben: Really?
David: Yeah. The motivation is like, oh, they're beautiful, they're luxurious cameras, they have leather on the, and we can put Hermes leather on the Leica cameras.
Ben: Yeah, if they made an Hermes edition Leica camera.
David: They did.
Ben: I should probably look into that.
David: Okay, you're talking about a very narrow target market here. It's a technology product. We'll get into this with Apple in a minute. It didn't go well, let's put it that way. They ended up divesting the stake.
Ben: It reminds me of when the New York Times did all of this with all the TV stations in the 90s too. It's almost like every company that ever thinks it's a good idea to start buying up other brands is wrong.
David: Yeah, unless that is the core strategy of what you are doing like LVMH.
Ben: Yes.
David: The third thing that they do, they incubate and create a new luxury brand and company in China called Shang Xia. I believe I'm pronouncing that right. 2009 is when they launched it. It literally means up down or past-present. The idea is that the Chinese market is so big and so important to Hermes. They're going to lend the Hermes brand to this new brand that is going to have Hermes principles, but take traditional Chinese craftsmanship of which there's a long multi thousand year history.
Ben: Yup. I actually like the strategy.
David: Yeah. It sounds good on paper, but here's the problem like we were talking about earlier. Nothing compares to French culture as an export and when you are buying luxury. This is a great experiment to run, sure. But the reality is that for probably most countries in the world, when you're talking about spending $20,000 on a piece of leather, you want that to be from Hermes and you want that to be from France. I think this is especially true in China.
Ben: Yeah, that's such a good point. It's funny. I have a playbook theme called selling a sense of place to those outside it. The numbers behind this are crazy. Today, 76% of their production is in France and 85% is sold outside of France.
First of all 76% of production in France is incredible the fact that they do this with all these different workshops that are scattered around the country. The incredible French history that is encapsulated by the brand, the French nobility, and the French sense of place, it really is just an intangible connection to the culture that is lusted after everywhere in the world. Why on earth would you throw that away when that really is the essence of your core asset?
David: Now, easy for us to armchair quarterback here. Obviously, it didn't work. They end up selling it off actually pretty recently to the Agnelli family from Italy, which is the family behind Fiat. Certainly that one, the Leica thing, it's the combination of all these and the beach bag incident. Bernard sees all this.
Here's what he says in the press at the time. "I would never diminish the quality of Hermes. Hermes can be an even rarer and greater quality business if they ever wanted to work with us." I think he's genuine about that. The family obviously circles the wagons and mounts their rebel alliance here, mounting their defense against the empire.
Ben: Which I think is quite impressive.
David: Absolutely.
Ben: The fact that they were able to link arms like this and say in the face of someone trying to make you and all your relatives collectively a multi billionaire in liquid cash, it's incredible to link arms and manage to rebuff it.
David: Totally. We'll tell the story here, and it's amazing. I think this is like a really important point that I want to land. I don't think Arnaud was wrong. I think he had a point, and I think the company at the time didn't get it. They certainly do now. Okay, what's the story? What happens? Finally, in October of 2010, Arnault is patient.
Ben: He spent nine years.
David: Nine plus years that he's just building this stake, being patient. In October, 2010 LVMH exercises its options on the equity swaps that it owns and announces that it had now controls 14.2% of Hermes shares. Bernard at the time says, I had to do it, because other luxury groups were also talking about making a run at Hermes, and I didn't want this crown jewel of France to be owned, heaven forbid, maybe by a non-French organization. A quote here, "I could not sit by and allow a competitor or another investor to take a stake in Hermes." He's good. He's so good.
Ben: I love it.
David: In response to this is the famous or infamous, if you will, quote from Patrick Thomas, the then CEO of Hermes, which we're not going to say the full thing here on air. You can go google it. This is an official press conference with investor relations people. He says, "If you want to seduce a beautiful woman," Obviously Hermes being the beautiful woman here, "You don't start in the fashion that Bernard is" And he doesn't use those words.
This is hilarious. This is amazing. That makes, of course, a huge splash in the French and international press. The drama here is delicious. Karl Lagerfeld is asked his thoughts on what's going on here. Lagerfeld, of course, is a legend. He's the longtime creative director of Chanel. He comments publicly. "If you don't want to be taken over, don't put your business on the public market."
Ben: Game recognize game. That's a great point.
David: He's got a point.
Ben: If you want liquidity, this is the trade off you make.
David: Of course, Lagerfeld, yes, famously is the creative director of Chanel, but he wasn't exclusively the creative director of Chanel, who he is also working for at this point in time. He is also, I believe, the men's wear creative director for Fendi, which is owned by By LVMH.
Ben: He's on payroll.
David: He's on payroll. This continues on for months in the public markets and in the press. By December of 2011, the LVMH stake has grown to 22.6%. The family owns 73% of the company at this point, so Bernard now owns almost the entire public float of Hermes.
Ben: There's 3.5% of Hermes that's publicly floated he doesn't own?
David: Yeah. Hermes is in danger of being delisted from the stock exchange.
Ben: Crazy.
David: This is what's so brilliant. You might ask, why does this matter? The family owned 73%, Bernard can't do anything. Price is a function of supply and demand. As Bernard is shrinking the float of this company, the shares that are available for trade on the public markets, what happens to the stock price?
Ben: Skyrocket.
David: It goes through the roof. Now you've got 80 family members, and they already thought they were really wealthy. They already wanted liquidity. Now, Bernard's coming to them. This is a strategy. Let's just go pick off individual family members one by one, keep increasing his stake, and saying, yeah, I'll pay you the market price, which is now incredibly inflated for this company. Great. Happy to pay you many hundreds of millions of dollars.
Ben: Crazy.
David: What happens? This is why I think this really was the family and the company's finest moment. That temptation must have been extreme. That's just the externally identifiable motivations. I'm sure Bernard, other people at LVMH, and everybody else in the industry is doing everything they can to convince family members to sell.
Ben: Right, and all it takes is one week link or probably a few week links, because the ownership is so divided into tiny chunks by this point. Six generations in, it's pretty peanut buttered around.
David: I think also just from a psychological perspective, a couple dominoes fall here. As a family member, you start looking around and being like, do I want to be the last one? It's like a crowded theater running for the exits. At the time, you're thinking about like, holy crap.
Ben: This is the best it's ever going to get.
David: I may never see another opportunity to get liquid at this price ever. The minute that other family members start selling, supply and demand, the price goes down.
Ben: Right, I cannot be the last, and it would suck to be the second or the third.
David: In 2011, the family comes together and over 50 of the 80 family members collectively contribute 50.2% of the equity in the company into a new cooperative vehicle that's called H51, as in 51% of Hermes, as in this vehicle will have majority control of the company. When they contribute their equity into this vehicle, they contractually agree that that equity will be locked up and cannot be sold at least 20 years.
They're basically saying that Bernard, no matter what you do, you could pick off anybody else after this for a minimum of 20 years with potential to extend beyond that. You will never, never, never, you or anybody else have control of Hermes.
Ben: It's so badass.
David: It's so badass.
Ben: Dude, you and I should contribute. We should make A51. Even though it's completely unnecessary, it just feels right for Acquired. I think you and I can each maintain 24.5% stakes, but A51 really should...
David: I love it. We haven't floated our business on the public markets yet, so we're taking Karl Lagerfeld's advice. We don't need to incur the legal fees around doing this. That vehicle was and is still headed by one of the family members, Julie Guerrand, who was an investment banker at Rothschild. She leaves and full time becomes head of the defense, I assume alongside Axel, who obviously comes from the banking world, too.
Ben: It's so interesting. I wonder if you actually can structure articles of incorporation to say under no circumstances, can this entity sell what it owns? Normally, what you would do is say, it requires a vote of unanimous from the board of directors, blah, blah, blah, but that leaves you vulnerable to the board of directors getting lobbied and convinced. This is not a public document, so we can't really know, but I wonder how airtight can you really make something and how irreversible?
David: I don't believe these documents are public. My understanding from comments that family members and Axel make about them, and spoiler alert, recently they've renewed the term of this for another 10 years, so it's into the mid 2040s.
Ben: They're like, Bernard, you will be dead when this expires. That's exactly what that is.
David: I believe it's pretty ironclad that these shares cannot be sold.
Ben: Wow.
David: In addition to that, two of the Puech brothers, Bertrand and Nicolas, Nicolas is the one that there's the gardener drama about right now.
Ben: We should say, listeners, in case you don't know, there's a lot of stories floating around in the press right now that Nicolas Puech is going to give half of his stake in Hermes, which represents something like a little under 3% to his gardener or his ex gardener, who's now 51, nobody knows his name.
David: Nicolas does not have children, heirs, or other heirs.
Ben: Right. There's a press story right now that just shy of 3% of Hermes could be given to the family gardener.
David: Anyway, the two Puech brothers do not contribute their shares to H51, but they give H51 a right of first refusal on their shares. They could sell their shares, but at whatever price they agree to, the rest of the family has an offer on purchasing them.
Ben: Interesting.
David: That's another, probably 10%-15% of Hermes right there.
Ben: Whoa. Okay, that's significant. I wonder how this gardener thing is going to play out.
David: Yeah. Those shares would be, I believe, subject to that offer, assuming that that has stayed in place. Anyway, this is really just an incredible coordination. Yes, it's a family, they're all family, but there are 80 people here.
Ben: The fact that they actually rebuffed this offer and that Bernard sold down his stake is crazy.
David: Let's get into what happens with Bernard's stake, because famously, as Domenico De Sole said in the press at the end of the Gucci affair, even when he loses, he still wins, and Bernard still wins here. This effectively ends the takeover bid when H51 is put in place. Meanwhile, there are all sorts of lawsuits going on, particularly around how LVMH amassed this stake in secret with the equity swaps.
Ben: It was basically illegal, right?
David: In 2014, the French court rules that this was illegal. LVMH has to pay a fine, I believe  a $10-$15 million fine for having done this.
Ben: Pennies.
David: Yeah, right. As we'll see, it's truly pennies. They also mandate that LVMH needs to distribute out that Hermes stake to its own shareholders. LVMH can no longer hold the stake. Who's the largest shareholder in LVMH? It's Group Arnault, which is Bernard Arnault's family office. They get 8% of Hermes personally into his family office entity. This is the brilliance of Bernard. They take that value, which is on the order of $5 billion. Remember, when they started buying, the whole company was trading at a market cap below $10 billion.
Ben: Massively appreciated stock. They basically created value out of nowhere here. This billions of dollars landing in Bernard's personal bank account, he has created that money out of nowhere.
David: He has unlocked shareholder value for sure, even in the absence of a change of control transaction. Back when Bernard was engineering his takeover of LVMH, one of the financial instruments that he used to do it was he IPO'd a 25% stake in Dior. He already owned Dior that he had gotten out of bankruptcy from Boussac.
Ben: That's right. He had this Russian doll structure, where he owned a slim majority of an entity that owned a slim majority of an entity, that owned a slim majority. He was able to generate a bunch of liquid cash from all the minority shares that he sold off, but he still got to control Dior, LVMH, Group Arnault, because he was technically the majority owner of each of them.
David: Yes, but he and LVMH didn't own this 25% minority stake in Dior. He takes the Hermes shares and does a share swap. Swaps that value directly with the 25% of Dior that he doesn't own to bring that first into Group Arnault, his family office, and then he trades that into LVMH. LVMH now, finally, as a result of this, is able to take 100% control of Dior.
In exchange for group are no trading this asset into Dior, Bernard's ownership of LVMH goes from 36% up to 46%. He gets an extra 10 percent of LVMH. Here's the most incredible aspect of this. Not a single dollar in tax is paid on all of this because it's all share swaps. Basically, Bernard just gets 10% more of his own company as a result of this.
Ben: Which would then go on to appreciate.
David: 400%-500% over the next five to six years.
Ben: 5x'd since 2017?
David: Yeah.
Ben: Wow. Even when he loses, he wins.
David: Unbelievable. This is a situation where everybody wins. I don't think there are any losers here. The Hermes families absolutely are not losers. You could even say they have the last laugh here. Yes, Bernard gets to benefit from an extra 4x-5x appreciation in LVMH's market cap here. From the real beginning of when LVMH publicly announces their stake in Hermes, 2010, Hermes' market cap is up 16x.
Ben: It's crazy. The reason why no one's a loser here and everyone's a winner is because Hermes truly is the crown jewel. It is such an unassailable, exceptional business. The last 12 months, it did $14 billion in revenue, $5.7 billion in operating income. They have a 71% gross margin and a 44% operating margin. It's a software business that doesn't need any R&D.
David: Tech companies go like, I don't know what Hermes color to call it, but some color with envy over this. There is one more chapter of the story that we have to tell, because that wouldn't have just happened. It wasn't just the Bernard affair in and of itself that led to this 16x market cap increase. He was right, like I was saying earlier. There were, I think, some real problems in the business. That is the story of the sixth generation of Pierre-Alexis and Axel, who I think have certainly fixed those problems, but have really led Hermes, the business, and the company into a whole new era.
Ben: Yes, that is absolutely right. There is a quote that I want to start with for the Axel Dumas era, which is possibly the best articulation that I've ever heard of business strategy anywhere. He did it in the interview that we were talking about. He says, "Every decision that we make has got some reverse effect." Which I think is like a French translation for trade off.
"Every decision we make has got some trade off. There's something I really like about strategy in Michael Porter. Strategy is accepting that you are doing something better than the other, and the other is doing something better than you. You have to pick your fight. I'm always a little bit disappointed when I see someone on my team say that we do everything at the same time. Great. That doesn't happen in real life. You have to pick your fight, and Hermes picks their fights better than anyone/"
David: What they've done over the last 10 years since the Bernard fight is that they have figured out how to scale handcrafted artisanal production.
Ben: Yes.
David: On the surface, those are completely oxymoronic terms. Those are completely diametrically opposed.
Ben: This is a dead art in the world, and Hermes manages to crank out hundreds of thousands of products that otherwise would only be created by individual makers with no infrastructure, no brand, it'd be really hard to discover them, and frankly, they would all just go out of business. Most of them go out of business anyway.
David: Totally. What was the stat that you said a little while ago that there are 120,000 Birkins and Kellys produced every year?
Ben: Yup, exactly.
David: If they were still making these things on the third floor at the Faubourg, no way. This was the problem and what the consultants were saying at the start of Jean-Louis' tenure of like, hey, you need to outsource production, you need to scale production, you need to make this more accessible.
Ben: Right, you have a global brand now. You need to figure out how to serve the demand for your brand.
David: Yup. The Patrick Thomas quote that I want to start with is so great. "The luxury industry is built on a paradox. The more desirable a brand becomes, the more it sells. But the more it sells, the less desirable it becomes." We've been talking about this whole episode, but then he continues. "I believe Hermes' vision provides a solution to this dilemma." This is what the current generation has found, the solution.
Today. I think we referenced this earlier in the episode, Hermes employs 7000 master craftspeople, artisans. Most of the story that we've been telling thus far, until 1992, all of the craftspeople in the company, more or less, were working in the Faubourg in this one relatively small building on the Rue Faubourg du Saint-Honoré in Paris.
In 1992, they moved production to Pantin in the suburbs of Paris. That building is amazing, but only houses about 250-300 craftspeople. Actually, still to this day, Axel talks about this a lot, any one of their production sites does not have more than 250-300 craftspeople.
Ben: Yes. They believe that every single person should know each other by name. They think that 250-300 is the natural limit on that. Axel even says, if you have more than 300, it is not a workshop, it's a factory.
David: Yup, and they are not in the business of factories. At the same time, he and the company have stated as an explicit goal that they will ramp up production capacity by 7% every year. As the company gets larger and larger, today that means adding 500 artisans every year.
Ben: Crazy. When Axel started at the company all the way back in the 80s, there were 250 craftsmen, period. They hired two craftsmen per year in the late 80s.
David: Right. Here's the issue though. How on earth are you going to do this? Like you were saying, this is a dead art. Nobody else does this.
Ben: Little maker with a workshop in San Francisco or a workshop in Paris, but how are you even going to find them?
David: Right. Those people, the Beatrices here in San Francisco, they're entrepreneurs. They're not going to go back to joining Hermes, because they all came from Hermes in the first place. How are you going to hire 500 a year? It's not like they can go higher from their competitors. They're not doing this.
Ben: Right. Their competitors have all outsourced production and embraced assembly lines.
David: They do the only thing that you can do. They build the pipeline of training master craftspeople and artisans entirely themselves. They build schools, they build training centers. They go to parts of France that are in rural areas, that have high unemployment.
They go to those areas, they open trade schools, and they say, we're going to train you. They have 100% graduation rates. They're like, we're not going to give up on you, we're going to make sure you learn this trade that you graduate. You may not come work for Hermes when you graduate, but we're going to give you this skill. Then we're going to offer you a job as a master craftsman.
Ben: It's crazy.
David: It's unbelievable. Even through the Jean-Louis era, the fifth generation, Beatrice was the anomaly as a woman. These were all old men that were doing this stuff. Today, the average age of the Hermes artisan workforce is 30 years old and 80% are women.
Ben: It's wild.
David: It's a wholesale transformation. They are training them. They actually just opened in 2021, their first official French governmentally sanctioned degree granting program, the École Hermès de Savoie Ferre. This is the savoir faire that pops up in the annual report a hundred whatever times.
Ben: Let's name a school after it too.
David: Yeah. They're getting into government policy here. They are preserving and growing this art form in France.
Ben: Yeah, they're not France's largest export, because they have a very constrained way that they can create the products, but they may be France's finest export. It behooves the French government to try to figure out how to make this last another hundred years.
David: Yup. Today, there are 31 Hermès ateliers, artisan manufacturing facilities all throughout the country, each with no more than 250-300 people in it.
Ben: Right. It's the cloud computing idea of scaling horizontally.
David: Totally. This is AWS. This is the point I'm getting to.
Ben: Right. They're building data centers.
David: They were Amazon and they added AWS. They are adding two to four of those every year.
Ben: It's so funny, you had that thought too. It's all people. It's all sticking to the thing that got them here, which is every product or at least every leather goods product, every handbag made end to end by one artisan trained in the traditional early 20th century way.
David: Speaking of cloud computing, we want to share a fun thing that our friends at NVIDIA have given us. For anyone considering attending GTC this year, Acquired listeners get a 20% discount. This is their big annual conference that Ben and I have watched over a dozen keynotes from to prep for our NVIDIA series.
Ben: Yup. It'll be March 18th-21st, 2024 at the San Jose Convention Center. It is the first time back in person in five years, which is crazy. It's the most important AI conference in the world. Jensen will be speaking to 10,000 people live in person.
David: Wow. There are also researchers speaking from OpenAI, Meta, Google, DeepMind, Microsoft, Forge, Genentech, Disney, National Labs, and more. It's crazy. They will have a whole bunch of futuristic vehicles, robots on display.
Ben: Yup. If you want to check it out, click the link in the show notes and enter the code ACQUIRED at checkout  to give you 20%. Thanks to our friends at NVIDIA. Now, back to Hermes.
David: This is an insane idea that leather goods, which is 43% of the business, Hermes did €11.6 billion in revenue last year. They're on track to probably do €14 billion.
Ben: Yup. The last 12 months is €14 billion.
David: Yeah. That €6 billion of that is going to be handcrafted items, where one artisan makes one item at a time, and they're sold around the world. €6 billion worth of that every year growing at 15%-20% a year? Yeah, wild.
Ben: This is a really important thing to understand about the company. (1) They firmly believe that only 250-300 craftsmen can work in a building. (2) It takes two-plus years for someone to learn the craft and apprentice. (3) Every one of these things must be created by one individual by hand. If you believe all those three things for sure, then it forces a very specific constraint on your business, and you must work backward from that.
You can only train so fast. You can only produce so fast, which then of course means that it affects your products, it affects the availability, and it affects the price, which of course means that it affects the customer set. There's a way to view Hermes, which is they want the very highest end customer with zero price sensitivity. They do whatever they need to serve that master.
I think there's another very real way to look at it, which is how the company describes themselves that starts with the constraints of the craft. When you hold true to that ethos at its most extreme, you end up with the company's brand and posture that you have today as the only logical end point. They can only hire 300, 400, or 500 craftsmen a year. They can only do this other stuff. Good luck getting a Birkin bag. It's just one of these things where you can say they're artificially constraining supply all you want.
David: As long as they do things this way, this is the max throughput.
Ben: They would have to change something. They would have to say, hey, There's some new fancy saddle stitching machine that it turns out makes us just as high a quality product, and every craftsman is twice as effective or something like that. But until they fold on one of these constraints that they've decided are stakes in the ground, the result is the scarcity. That's not the goal, that's the result.
David: Yeah. The Amazon comparison is so apt here. Hermes has this incredible unassailable flywheel, but it operates in the exact opposite way of an Amazon flywheel. It's not about maximizing the cycles, it's slowing. It's minimizing. It's an intentionally rate limited flywheel, and it all works together.
Ben: At the end of the day, it is probably true that neither one is the starting place, and neither one is the ending place. The two things that I'm referring to here are the method of craftsmanship and the price and scarcity. They just work harmoniously together. One is not driving the other. It is that they both want the brand posture that they have, and they want the constraints that they have, so it works together perfectly.
A cynical person could be like, well, yeah, all that handcrafted mumbo jumbo only exists, because that's how you justify the brand pricing and availability that they've put in place. But I think it all works in concert.
David: Totally. We've told the whole episode. I'm thinking back to what Beatrice told me when I asked her why. If a master craftsperson made this thing by hand, it has a soul. If a machine made it in an assembly line, it does not.
Ben: Right. Maybe, but sure. In an assembly line with crappy ingredients, blah, blah, blah, sure, but can craftsmen use better tools? Yes. Will Hermes continue to embrace tools that make craftsmen more efficient? At some point, did they use sharper knives than were previously available in the past? They totally did. Will they use things that make the needle go a little faster? Maybe.
David: Totally. Let's take a step back here. We got to consider the exact opposite case study of this, which is a hundred percent happening to great success, which in a lot of ways is the same thing that the consultants told Jean-Louis back in the day, look at the rest of the industry. Louis Vuitton, which as we talked about, has the same caliber of heritage and history as Hermes.
Ben: Yes. It could have Hermes's gravity if it wanted to, but instead you can buy a checkerboard cotton sweatshirt with 120 LVs on it.
David: Right. They are having the same level of success, the same margins. It's working like a charm.
Ben: But it's less durable.
David: I think that's the question. Is it less durable, or is it just that these are different strategies? Here's the crux of it that we've also been teasing on the episode that I think now's the time to come back to, this thing that I'm wearing on my wrist, the Apple Watch partnership.
Ben: Out of left field, very surprising, very odd for the brand to do this.
David: I have a lot of complicated feelings about the thing on my wrist, including primarily that I love it. Okay, here's the story. In 2015, Apple launches the Apple Watch. Supposedly, the story goes that Jony Ive, and the watch I think was really Jony's pet project as his last hurrah before leaving Apple, he had all these quotes at the time of the Swiss watch industry, better watch out, we're coming for them, et cetera.
Ben: Which was true. Different market, but it's by far the best selling watch in the world.
David: Yes, but as far from been the death knell of the Swiss watch industry.
Ben: Right, yeah. The Swiss watch industry has done just fine since the Apple watch came out on the high end.
David: Yes. Marc Newson was consulting for Apple specifically on the watch, and Jony asked Marc to introduce him to Pierre-Alexis, Axel, and to Hermes. Apple was looking for a luxury fashion brand. Remember, there is the Apple watch edition in the beginning that was like the gold Apple watch and all that.
Ben: Man, $10,000 for something that was going to be obsolete in a year. It's crazy.
David: Yeah. That clearly didn't work.
Ben: But it's beautiful.
David: Yeah, totally beautiful, but they needed a luxury brand. They needed a brand that was not deeply in bed with the traditional Swiss watch industry, which some of these luxury groups are.
Ben: It's funny. I hadn't actually made that connection that that's why it's Hermes and not...
David: I think there are two reasons. That's one reason. The other reason is they needed a brand that was going to appeal to pretty much everybody. For everything we've talked about with Louis Vuitton and how successful that's been, it's polarizing.
Ben: Totally. Apple also needed to go to the very top of whatever they were going to grab. The thing about Hermes is whatever they make...
David: Nobody is ever going to say that Hermes makes crap.
Ben: Right. They make the most fully realized version of whatever they're making. If they have an idea, they want to release the best possible, most extreme, exquisite version of that thing. That's very Apple. Apple has to make compromises for the scale that they're at. But if Apple had partnered with someone that was more opinionated, let's say they were better in some ways but worse than others, it doesn't play for Apple's brand. They need to partner with someone unassailable.
David: Axel and Pierre Alexi talk about this all the time when they're asked about, oh, XYZ flashy celebrity is carrying a Birkin bag, blah, blah, blah, they say, look, we don't judge. We never judge here at Hermes. Our clients are our clients, whether it's Grace Kelly or Kim Kardashian. That's what Apple needed.
Axel has a great quote on this. He says, "We had an incredible talk with Jonathan Ive, and there was a lot of mutual admiration and common values. From that, we said, wouldn't it be nice to have something combining our craftsmanship, our vision? It was about trying to make a contemporary, elegant object. It was not a master plan of global domination."
Okay. This thing on my wrist is exactly what Axel is saying there. It is a contemporary, elegant object that is beautiful leather. The reason I bought it is for my life and modern life, this thing is on my wrist 23 hours a day. I sleep with it.
Ben: A hundred percent. I love the Hermes slim to Hermes watch. I looked at that thing five times during research lusting after it and ultimately closed the browser tab being like, I wear an Apple watch all day every day. There's just no world where it actually makes sense for me to own a different watch.
David: Right. Even more than my phone, this thing is part of me. When I was looking to do research for this episode and buy a bit of the Hermes dream, I couldn't imagine anything more appropriate be closer to me than literally it's on my wrist 23 hours a day. At the same time, I find it absolutely terrifying from the perspective of what it means for Hermes and the Hermes' future, not because I think that Apple and technology is going to take over the world, but I think there are some serious problems with this product along the lines of the issues that Bernard identified in the company when he was making his run.
Let's start with the price. I bought the deployment buckle version of the strap, because I thought it looked amazing. It is the most expensive version of the band that Hermes sells as such, and it costs $540.
Ben: Which is expensive for an Apple watch band, but it's in the ballpark of Apple accessories, or it's at least maybe twice as much as normal Apple accessories.
David: This is among the cheapest leather products that Hermes sells. As a comparison, if you want to go buy an Hermes luggage tag, $640. Let's move out of leather goods for a second. If you want to go buy an Hermes sweatshirt, over $2000. If you want to buy an Hermes piece of furniture, and they make incredibly beautiful furniture, $40,000 minimum. $540 for this thing, it's not priced right for an Hermes product. It's too low.
Ben: It's somehow bridging the gap between an Apple product and an Hermes product.
David: Yes, and maybe that's because it's also sold in Apple stores, et cetera. But related to that, you start to think about that, wait, why is the price so low? On the exquisite orange packaging and box that this thing came in, nowhere on it nor on the product page on the website does it say that it was handmade.
Ben: So Hermes' belts, I believe they're Apple watches, and there are other things, are machine zone?
David: This to me is like, wow. Would I have spent $2000 on a handmade Apple Watch Hermes band? Maybe, maybe not. I don't know. Whether I would have is irrelevant. Hermes should be selling $2000 handmade Apple Watch bands.
Ben: Even if people aren't buying them, that's the question. I agree with you, because what I think this does is it defies how I think of Hermes, which is whatever they're going to do, they're going to do it at the logical extreme. They're not going to compromise. They're not going to figure out how to address a lower market. They're going to sell the same expensive scarf that they sold their grandma to you, but they're going to have a different way to advertise it. This is weird.
David: It's weird.
Ben: It's a compromise. I think the same thing about their belts, by the way. I think the same thing about anything that is machine sewn so it can be mass produced and have availability in every store. It feels like they don't promise that everything they make is hand sewn, but it feels like a mild violation of the brand promise.
David: Right, yeah. I don't know. On the one hand, I love it. I don't want any other Apple watch strap. It is an Hermes product. It's beautiful. On the other hand, yeah, it feels like a profanity.
Ben: You're right, it does feel like a profanity. Apple is the you know most valuable brand in the world, but the most common brand in the world. For Hermes to associate with such a common brand feels odd. Apple is the definition of mass market at this point.
David: I think that is certainly part of it The thing that is really just head scratching to me about it is, why did they not sell these things for four times as much and make them by hand? What are they getting out of selling a machine made strap for $540?
Ben: Maybe you're now an Hermes customer and over the next 50 years, you're on a journey with them.
David: I think that's true. I mean, I'm going back tomorrow.
Ben: What are you getting tomorrow?
David: I don't want to spoil Jenny's birthday/Valentine surprise. I'm actually getting two things, but we'll talk about this on a future episode.
Ben: Okay. Sounds good. Cliffhanger.
David: Cliffhanger. Just to put some numbers and finish out the story, by 2018, revenue has grown from €3.5-€4 billion when Axel took over in 2013. By 2018, that's €6 billion. In 2019, it's €7 billion. It dips a bit during 2020 with the pandemic, but then €9 billion in 2021. Last year, €11. 6. Like we said, on track for €14 billion in 2023. This is an absolutely resounding success.
As we've said, what Axel, Pierre-Alexis, and this generation of the family has done like all the generations before them has been nothing short of amazing, starting with the defense against Bernard. Incredible. I don't want to fully judge or leave a negative mark on the company solely because of the Apple watch thing, but I just got to say, we've seen with a few times here in these generations that the seeds of the next challenge are sown in the current generation. I wonder if this is it here.
Ben: Hermes has always thrived by figuring out how to be above it all and it be counterposition to the rest of luxury. It's an open question, I think, of whether the Apple partnership helps that or hurts that. Okay, a few more stats on the business today before we move into analysis. Does that sound good to you, David?
David: Great.
Ben: I thought one fascinating thing was Axel saying that with the 4. 3 billion in net income that they do, they always split it roughly the same way. One third to the dividend, one third gets reinvested in capex, and one third in cash. What's pretty interesting is, they have a reasonably low reinvestment rate. They're dividending out a lot of cash, and they're holding onto a lot of cash. Two thirds of it.
What's obvious there in the numbers that we've talked about in a more subjective way is they have a limited ability to actually reinvest in the business. It's much like Costco. They're constrained by factors other than capital. You give them more money, they can't do anything with it, which I just find fascinating. They can only train the craftspeople so fast.
Frankly at some point, they'll saturate the market too. If they're going to address the whole world, they're going to have to change what they sell, and the Apple Watch may be the first little version of that. They grew 20%-25% last year. They can't keep growing at 25% without changing what Hermes stands for. Even if they could train these craftspeople as fast as possible, they have another governor, which is scarcity, product image, price. At some point, they'll bump up against the walls of that, and no additional craftspeople and no additional money can help them grow anymore.
David: That's such a good point. That's the counterpoint to my impassioned concern a minute ago. Okay, great, David, everything you were just saying, that translates to Hermes is a museum, and Hermes is not a museum. It has to meet its clients where they are. Like I said, I wear this thing 23 hours a day. I couldn't imagine buying any other product from them.
Ben: I'm sure there are some members of the family that want to walk around with their nose in the air, be a museum, and say, Hermes is pure, and I want to go my whole life and then die with Hermes remaining pure. There are other members of the family that are like, can we serve customers and grow this business? My God. That Apple Watch represents the second faction.
David: Yup, totally.
Ben: Next, their cash position. They've got $10 billion in cash, and that is after materially increasing the dividend for the first time in a decade. They've recently just started dividending out more cash, which again is emblematic of the same idea of money is not our constraint, which is pretty new for the business. That's a decade or two old problem that never existed over the first 170 years.
An interesting thing to know about a business is it was always run under the constraint of even if we see growth opportunities, we don't have enough cash to pursue all of them. Now they actually do. It's interesting to see how management responds in this opportunity for abundance that they have and figures out how to treat certain elements of the business as a scarce resource, even though they don't have to.
David: Yup. Now, certainly there is an element too to the dividend that is part of making the family shareholding lock up an easier pill to swallow.
Ben: Yes, quite palatable. The segments of the business, leather goods and salary is 43%. That's the big guy. We didn't talk about this much on the episode, but ready to wear and accessories is 27%. That's a big chunk.
The second largest chunk of the business is clothing, effectively. I have an open question of whether they should be in clothing. Isn't it antithetical? Certainly, it's odd to see them in the fashion world, and they do these runway shows, and they do couture, but it feels weird. It somehow feels antithetical in some way.
David: Yeah. They're not a fashion brand, and yet they participate in it.
Ben: Yup. Next largest segment after that is silk and textiles. It's so remarkable how small the scarf business has become of their overall mix given that it used to be close to half the business. After that is perfume and beauty at 4%, watches at 4%, and then there's a couple categories of others, which I think it's really interesting to look at perfume and beauty as another glimpse of what's to come. They make a hundred dollar bottles of perfume, and they sell them at department stores.
David: Yup, and they launched beauty in 2020 with lipstick.
Ben: Yup, which I think is very China focused. It's very interesting to me that they are trying to appeal, especially to a younger demographic, with a lot of their recent perfumes and selling in department stores. Again, it feels antithetical to Hermes as this pure brand. But on the other hand, it's a continuation of the Apple Watch strategy even further.
David: Yup. There's one more elephant in the room to me that we haven't addressed via the story, which is that the business is a global business for sure, but really today, this business is an Asia business.
Ben: Yeah. Here are some stats. In 2006, France was already down to 19% of sales. It started at 100% of sales, so that's why I say down to 19% in 2006. This is a while ago or almost 20 years ago. At that point in time, Japan represented 27% of sales. There's all this talk about China and luxury today, Japan was that in the early 2000s. Crazy, right? Japan was one and a half times France in terms of sales for Hermes.
Today, France is down to just 9% of sales. Let's flash back to 2006 again. We talked about Japan being at 27% of sales. Asia Pacific, outside of Japan, was only 17%. Japan was almost one and a half times as large as rest of Asia. Today, rest of Asia is 48%. Half of Hermes' business is Asia excluding Japan.
David: AKA China.
Ben: Exactly. That's crazy. I think Russia accounted for a decent amount of that.
David: Interesting. The Japan story, actually, I think is still significant. Japan today is 10% of revenue?
Ben: Yeah, Japan's larger than France. It's 9% in France, 10% in Japan.
David: Right. I actually looked into that and was like, huh. The rest of Asia, again, AKA China is 48% of the business. But on a per capita basis, Japan buys twice as much Hermes as China.
Ben: That's interesting.
David: Still, Japan is, I believe, around a 10th of the size of China and is 10% of Hermes sales versus 48% for rest of Asia. For a small country, like France, it's still very, very significant for the business.
Ben: Yeah. I will say that you listen to management commentary. Hermes is very excited about China's middle class, and they have done a really good job SKUing younger there. Eighty percent of clients in China are below 40.
David: Wow. Again, this is a huge, unique success for Hermes. China has been big for the whole luxury industry over the last decade plus, but the past few years, particularly the last two years, China has been real tough for the luxury industry, and yet Hermes is still growing there.
Ben: Yup. Employee count, they have 21,000 total employees, 7000 are artisans, 62% of employees work in France. They really have stayed French, they've not outsourced. They have 54 production sites in France or what they call workshops, and they manufacture 76% of the objects that they sell in their stores in their own exclusive workshops. They do still have these partnerships with other companies that they own part of, just have a partnership with, or a distribution deal with. Usually what it means is it's sold as an Hermes product, but it's made by another manufacturer.
Over the years, they've done this with shoes, umbrellas, leather jackets, raincoats, silverware, and glove. They've had all these independent craftsmen that they contracted with who have these really small shops, really small operations, and don't have the brand reach that Hermes does, but they make Hermes products that are actually made by those people. So it's interesting. I think they are decreasing that when I give the number that at this point, 76% of objects are made in its own exclusive workshops, but it is more correct than not to think about Hermes as they control everything from design to production, to brand, to retail today.
David: Yup. I think a lot of those, there's a silversmith and a tableware manufacturer that they own large stakes into, so it's like a related party.
Ben: Yup,  exactly They have over 300 stores in 45 countries. David, as I mentioned earlier, in 2020, the Wall Street Journal estimated that about 120,000 Birkin and Kelly bags were made in that year. That's about 25%-30% of total revenue coming from just those two bags, which again, you can't buy, and also, you can't even see.
David: Yeah, they're not on display in the stores.
Ben: I went to a few Hermes stores over the last year, (1) because I love the brand, (2) because I was thinking we might do this episode at some point. I saw zero Birkin or Kelly bags even on display. This is the thing that they generate all their buzz about and make 30% of their revenue from, and you can't see it in a store. Crazy.
David: Totally crazy.
Ben: If you just do some napkin math at 25 hours per bag, that's 1500 craftsmen just making Birkins and Kellys all day long.
David: Sounds about right.
Ben: They have 16 métiers, and one in particular that I want to talk about is Petit H. This is one of my favorite Hermes things, period. It started in 2010. It's a very interesting idea. For other leather brands, you typically see them trying to use the second best leather cut in some of their bags, but at Hermes they'll never do that. There's no bag that's ever produced with any imperfections or any part of the leather that they think is any lesser than the best.
What do they do with all that leftover material? For years, they were just storing it. This is everything from the leathers to the felts, to the silks. All this extra material where they were just like, there's a tiny little bit that's usable, but not enough to actually make another bag to our standards, so into the closet it goes.
In 2010, they launched Petit H. What they basically do is they collaborate with other artists for tiny little goods that can be cut from the scraps, that are super whimsical, super fun. Think luggage tags that are cute little animals. It's just enough of a shape to know that it's a bull, a bear, or a cat. You look at it and you're like, oh, that's really clever What they call it is creation in reverse, you start designing with the materials, not the end product in mind.
It's the opposite of everything else that Hermes has ever done, which is think about what's the perfect good we can create to solve this problem for a customer. This was like, no, we've got a bunch of scraps, what's fun stuff we can do? That is that whimsy coming through.
David: Yes.
Ben: One thing that I want to say about the luxury bubble cooling is that earlier, I chalked it up to, well, Hermes has the most exclusive brand posture, so they have the least price sensitive customers, so they're going to feel the pullback less than everyone else. That is true, but there are other parts of it too.
Hermes' obsession with responsible growth, limiting production, and slower price appreciation also plays into the desirability and the durability of their goods. If they were out there cranking the prices of Birkin bags, you might think less of them. If they were out there trying to produce more of them to meet demand, you'd certainly think less of them, if they were outsourcing production anyway. It's how they conduct business that has caused them to be in a better position than the rest of the luxury industry right now in this pullback.
David: I'm glad you reminded me to bring this up. When we were talking earlier about the question of the secondary market and why are they leaving pricing power on the table.
Ben: Essentially, there's consumer surplus in economic terms.
David: Right. I said, I think they increased prices across the product range by about 7% per year. Where I got that from is if you look at the compounded annual revenue growth rate of Hermes for the last 10 years, the sixth generation era, it's 15%. Revenue has grown 15% compounded annually since Axel took over in 2013. They've increased production 7% per year. That's their stated goal.
If you say, okay, of the 15% revenue growth, take out the 7% production growth, that leaves 7%-8%. That's got to be attributable to price increases, which I think this is the answer. Is it the right strategy? Probably it is the right strategy if you're thinking about, hey, this is a generational business, we're on the 6th generation. We want to ensure it's around for the 12th generation. Yes, we're leaving consumer surplus on the table here, because we don't want to be seen as that brand that is $100,000 handbags, even though they are $100,000 handbags.
Ben: Right. Yeah, there's a fine line.
David: There's a gaucheness to it.
Ben: Right, exactly. They need to have a price that's high enough to signal this is something really, really special. We are more unique than every other luxury brand who's trying to make similar products and have similar positioning, but also it's not so expensive that it's gauche. I think the latter part, it's not actually about the dollar amount. It's about the price difference, because if it's three times as much as it was a decade ago, it's harder to trust the intrinsic value of the good if it's fluctuating all over the place.
David: There probably is an element of defense that they can fall back upon of, well, yes, we sell these things for $12,000, $20,000, whatever. But the moment you take possession, you can turn around and sell it for more.
Ben: This is an intentional strategy over a Rolex. They increase prices a certain amount per year, and they want to show a track record of that so that if you buy one, you can rest assured that it's going to increase in value over time and that it's a good investment, because counterintuitively, by increasing the price more than the rate of inflation every year, or especially more than the rate of 5%-7% stock market return, it spurs people to buy that otherwise wouldn't have bought because they feel more safe making the purchase.
David: This concept landed for me during our Porsche episode, working with Doug DeMuro. There's a class of. Almost every car that you would ever buy. The old adage is true that the day you drive it off the lot, it's worth 20% less than it was the day when you bought it. For luxury cars, collectors, cars, rare cars, et cetera, the opposite is true. These are investment vehicles. If you buy a Carrera GT, you're going to spend a million dollars for it, but you can also be confident that you're not going to lose money on that purchase. It's an investment.
Ben: Right. There's a business unit that we didn't talk about yet called Hermes Horizons.
David: Yes, which is not an official métier, right?
Ben: It is not a métier. They break it out under other products. They have four categories of other products. There's Internet of Things, which is Apple Watch. There's tanneries and precious leathers. There's metal parts, which is a J3L subsidiary that I think literally makes the clasps and stuff like that.
David: My deployment buckle.
Ben: Yes, and then there's Hermes Horizons.
David: This is so great.
Ben: Hermes Horizons is perfectly named. What it basically says is...
David: If you have a private jet and you want it outfitted with Hermes seats, we've got the division for you.
Ben: We will make you seats.
David: Yes. There's an amazing quote from an article, probably 10, 15 years old. The person who is running this division said something like, "We get a lot of clients who come in here, and they want a big H on whatever it is they want us to make. We have to have a discussion with those clients that if that's what you want, we are not the place for you." It's so great. Maybe one day be Hermes Horizons customers.
Ben: Maybe, we'll see.
David: All right. Let's transition officially to analysis and start with power as we always do. Hamilton Helmer's Seven Powers.
Ben: Listeners, this is the question of what enables a given business to achieve persistent differential returns or to be more profitable than their closest competitor on a sustainable basis. The seven that Hamilton has identified are counter positioning, scale economies, switching costs, network economies, process power, branding, and cornered resource.
The question we asked, David, on the LVMH episode was for luxury brands, is there anything else other than branding power? The definition of branding power is if I present you two identical objects, and one of them is branded and one of them is unbranded, it is literally quantified as the premium that you are willing to pay me for the brand. In Hermes' case, it may not actually be branded, but you might still know it as Hermes and be willing to pay more for it.
David: Yeah. If you know, you know.
Ben: Yes. Again, we're drawing a lot of attention to quiet luxury here. Hermes is not as quiet luxury as they once were. I think it's safe to say it would have an H, a horse, woven H into the fabric, or something like that if presented to you here. But obviously, there's a tremendous amount of branding power.
David: On the LVMH episode, we talked a lot about, and I think this truly was maybe the most brilliant thing that Bernard Arnault did. He realized when nobody else did that there were scale economies in luxury to a group of luxury brands. There's the opposite of scale economies to an individual luxury brand, but at the group level, there is power and specifically scale economies power that does not exist the brand level. Clearly, none of that is happening here.
Ben: Yup. Okay. I have two cases to make for non-brand powers that come into play.
David: Okay, great.
Ben: Cornered resource.
David: Yes, I agree. They literally have all the craftsmen.
David: Agree.
Ben: Except for the ones that are opening their own independent shop, and those ones don't have brand power. An Hermes craftsman can make a wallet, an independent craftsman can make a wallet, you're going to pay a lot more for the Hermes one. In fact, you're never even going to be aware that the independent craftsman exists. If someone else wanted to go compete with Hermes, it'd be hard because they don't have the brand, they don't have the history, but also, you literally can't find any more craftsmen, so you'd have to train them yourselves.
David: I think even the other luxury brands out there, most of them probably do have some craftsmen, some stuff that's done by hand, some components of some products done by hand. But nobody does what Hermes does, and Hermes does all the craftsmen, so cornered resource for sure.
Ben: Yup. The other one that is a little bit squishier, are they counter positioned to other luxury brands by basically saying, hey, we don't have to serve as many customers as you, so we actually can handcraft each item individually? Louis Vuitton has no ability to switch gears and say, ooh, it's important to compete on the vector of handcrafted.
David:  Right, there are a lot of t shirts out there.
Ben: Right. They have to serve too many customers, but Hermès doesn't. It's flimsy counter positioning.
David: No. I like that, actually. It's rare to have counter positioning at scale. As Hamilton would put it, counter positioning is usually a takeoff phase power. I think there's an element of that. You could dissect how much of that particular element is actually part of the Hermes brand versus counter positioning in and of itself, but I buy it. I think at the end of the day, though, we spent however long this episode will be when it ships, recounting the myth of the brand here like brand is the power.
Ben: Yup, brand is the power.
David: Yes.
Ben: Okay, playbook. I called David earlier this week and said, we have a problem There's this really good part of the LVMH episode, and we're going to need to repeat it point for point on the Hermes episode, and that is why handbags are just the best freaking product to sell ever as a business. David planted the seed with me. Perhaps it's actually going to be a pretty different point once we really tell the whole story. David, you are right.
The point that was made on the LVMH episode are handbags are the best product ever because they're super easy to sell versus clothing. They don't require you trying anything on or sizing. You look at it. If you like it, you buy it, done. Much better than a fashion product. They're easier to create and produce than perfumes, which is another common luxury category
The profit margin is astounding for most luxury brands. The profit is between 10 and 12 times the cost to make them. At Louis Vuitton, it's something like 13 times, so there's this ease of creation. There's high volume according to annual consumer surveys that coach does the average American woman purchased two new handbags in 2000. By 2004, that number was more than four, so it's this high volume product.
At Louis Vuitton's immense four floor global store in Tokyo, 40% of all sales are made in the first room, which sells only monogrammed handbags, wallets, and other leather goods. Basically, none of these are true for Hermès. The business is not high volume or not nearly as high volume as they could be. In fact, they don't even show you handbags in their stores, so certainly not in that first room.
David: It's amazing. At least in the Palo Alto Hermes, which is what I've most recently been in, you walk in and you would think this is a home wearers company. There's a lot of table wear and there's a lot of furniture.
Ben: There's clothing, there's ready to wear.
David: There's clothing, there are some leather goods, and there are scarves. You would really think, wow, I'm in the most expensive Ikea ever.
Ben: It's such a funny way to describe it. In terms of trying on the handbags, when you do get your moment in the sun, and you have your 90-minute appointment and your glass of champagne, and you have the opportunity to buy one of the two or three Birkin bags that they have in store...
David: You can't say no, you have already accepted.
Ben: Right. It doesn't have the benefit of saving square footage the way that I mentioned. Oh, you don't need to try on handbags. There's nothing to impede your velocity. Hermes is impeding your velocity, and they're taking up square footage with these private rooms for you to go and spend time in. They don't take advantage of that benefit either.
The only thing that it has in common are these goods are sold at a phenomenal margin, just like Louis Vuitton. I came around to this idea that actually, we're not making any of the same points at all. They managed to sell the same exact product category totally different, and they've constructed an entirely different business model around the same products.
David: Yes. I think that's really the story here. Yes, there are other brands. There's Chanel, there's Gucci, there's Sicilia. I don't want to say that those luxury brands and those handbag brands are not incredible. They are, but there's Hermes and there's Louis Vuitton. They're both connected all the way back to Empress Eugenie, France, the nobility, and all of that. It's so interesting that they have such different strategies and they are the two pinnacles.
Ben: Right. This is a good moment to bring up this idea that Hermes likes to espouse that they have no marketing department.
David: Yes. This is a whimsical element of Hermes that I love.
Ben: Yes. They make the point that everyone at the company is responsible for marketing, which is wonderful. What a great comment, but there's some truth to it. There's obviously a lot of PR, events, and stuff that they do, but it's worth looking at some of the numbers. They spend 23% of their revenue on sales and marketing costs, but just a small fraction of that is actually on marketing or what they call communication. It's just 4.5% of their revenue.
If you compare that to LVMH, which spends over one third of their revenue on sales and marketing combined, that's 23% for sales and marketing at Hermes compared to 33% at LVMH. That's a huge difference. When you compare apples to apples just on marketing, LVMH says they spend 12% of total sales on advertising and promotion. Hermes spends 4.5% on communication. I think that is actually apples to apples.
David: Yeah, that's the media spend of Hermes, I believe.
Ben: It's still not right though. It's all marketing, that 4.5% versus 12%. Remember, you pointed out to me earlier before recording, two thirds of Hermes' communication is actually events. If you look at the remaining third, it might be as low as one and a half percent of their sales are actually spent on media buys for marketing compared to LVMH's 12%.
David: Yeah. This is really cool I saw a very large, splashy media buy from Hermes very recently. I was shocked when I saw it because I didn't expect it, but then doing all the research, understanding the strategy, it makes total sense to me. It was at the Ballet here in San Francisco at SFB at the program for Mere Mortals, which was as I talked about on the Novo Nordisk episode, we went to see at opening night, just incredible, incredible piece allegory for Pandora's box, AI, and ballet in the modern world here in San Francisco.
The back of the program was a full page Hermes ad. I was like, whoa, I think I texted you a picture. I was like, Hermes is buying full page marketing ads. But no, this is in the program at the ballet. This is not on the back of Vogue. There's a difference.
Ben: Right. This is, in some ways, event spend.
David: Yes. It's much closer to that.
Ben: They also go really hard when they're going to spend money. They don't blanket the world. They decide these concentrated ways that they want to do something really unique and special. That's how they spend their media buys.
David: Also, their event spend, you might say, wait, how did they spend twice as much on events as they do on media? You haven't read about Hermes events. Even just the pure marketing events like a store launch or product launch, they'll spend a million dollars on a party.
Ben: Right. Another place that they save a lot of money is that they don't do celebrity endorsements, unlike virtually every other luxury brand. This gets back to control, control, control. Hermes is the master of its own image. In these other companies, celebrities do dumb stuff all the time, and it reflects on the company. You have to change your spokesperson. You look at Kanye. You have to just decide to stick with him and tough it out, and Nike has done this a number of times, to say, we think we're going to come out the other side, and we think they're going to get through this.
Hermes, no. We control our own image, no one else reflects on us. Who needs celebrity endorsers when you make your products so desirable and so expensive that the celebrities will just buy them anyway, and they want to be seen in it? There are celebrities running around who get paid to endorse other brands, who will pay full price to wear Hermes out and about.
David: Part of the status is getting the ability to buy one, getting the appointment with your SA, spending the money. That's part of the status.
Ben: Not only is it revenue generating and cost saving, but it's also more powerful than a paid endorsement because it's authentic. It is what the celebrity is choosing to do with their dollars.
David: Yup. I'm pretty sure that Grace Kelly bought her Sac a Depeches.
Ben: Unbelievable. At the end of the day, the Hermes brand really has a tremendous amount of word of mouth from people who are big fans of it. The brand is built through the lore around the products. They just don't need to do that much media because they have a community. They have slowly organically built this, at this point, large number of people around the world that aspire to buy Hermes. Honestly, they just don't need to do that much marketing.
David: This is going to sound absurd on the surface, but I think it's true. That audience is incredibly diverse. That audience is lots of customers in the Middle East. That audience is 40% plus China. That audience is still French people with the preface de in their names, i.e., old nobility. That audience is the wealthiest people in America. That audience is Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion.
Ben: As we talked about earlier, somehow there's something about the French heritage that everyone else is willing to, status wise, look up to and want to participate in.
David: Yup. I don't think we want to go down this rabbit hole, but there is a whole TikTok and Instagram culture of Hermes sales associate appointments, Birkin appointments and reveals, and all that. It's huge. There are millions and millions of people that watch this.
Ben: Yup. One thing that we did not talk about is how they merchandise the stores. This is another thing that sets Hermes apart from other brands. They have a pull model versus a push model for all you software engineers out there. Basically, they embrace this idea that every store is for the local clientele and that store managers know their clients the best. Therefore, store managers should get to pick what is in each store.
Headquarters does not dictate what every store stocks, which is super different than every other brand. You open retail stores in order to just get your product out. The point is distribution. Whatever salespeople we hire to work at those stores, they're going to sell the same iPhones and iPads that we have everywhere else at every other store. That is not Hermes.
At Podium every year, which is this event that they have every six months where they show off all the new references, here's all the new designs for all the new products, each store manager gets a budget. They have the freedom to "buy" basically stock and get allocations of whatever they want at their store under the constraint that you can't ask for 120,000 Birkin bags at your one store.
David: I believe there's also regulation that every store needs to carry at least one item from each métier.
Ben: That's cool. I didn't realize that. I like that.
David: This operates like a retail buying event. It's bizarre, but awesome.
Ben: Even though they're wholly owned, they get the benefit of not being wholly owned.
David: Right, the market signals.
Ben: The cool thing about a retailer that's decoupled from the manufacturer is that the retailer can stock whatever cool stuff they want. As long as the métiers are all producing a diverse set of references, then you actually do get this diversity of different things that are stocked at that store for that region. It leads to this cool thing that no two stores are identical. It's fun to see what this Hermes shop has versus that Hermes shop whenever you travel.
David: There's a Costco treasure hunt element to it.
Ben: Yes, exactly. I will tell you, I was in the Aix-en-Provence store. Someone came in and said, I want to buy this particular item. The store manager said, well, we don't have it. They have a policy against anyone calling ahead to know what's where. He was asking, well, can you call the other store that I think was in Marseille or something like that and see if they have it there? She said, no, we don't do that. You can go there and you can find out.
I think this person was trying to buy something and flip it. They were on to that. He was also trying to take pictures of things in the store and they said, you can't do that, sir. You can't take photos of what we have in stock, because they don't want people standing up websites to say, tip, go buy this here cause you can flip it online for that much. They have pretty tight controls around that.
David: I love it. Luxury strategy, anti love marketing number six, dominate the client.
Ben: Dominate the client. Their ecommerce strategy is just pretty funny. It's not like you can go online and buy a Birkin bag, but there's not even a product detail page with a sold out button. There's just this educational page about what Birkin bags are all about, how neat the designs are, and what the category is.
David: But there's no buy button.
Ben: It's also for a different audience. Interestingly, 70% of buyers online for all the stuff that you can buy online were new to Hermes. That's a great strategy for them for ecommerce that you say, look, the special things are the special things. But for people who we want to come experience the brand for the first time, great, we've got a website for you.
I think you can sort of tell that internally they're torn, since that's not the full Hermes experience. You don't get the experiential part of being in the store. But they also do a lot of volume through it, it's a way to reach a new audience, and it's an expectation at this point.
David: This is a really uniquely Hermes thing and is related to their airport strategy too. I experienced this too. When I went to Palo Alto, I just walked into the store. I was pretty intimidated as a first time buyer and you don't have an SA or sales associate relationship. It can feel very intimidating, especially knowing what I know about the company and the brand, the weight of history, walking into this store. It's not like walking into an Ikea.
This is very intentional, the ecommerce strategy. The airport strategy is, hey, nobody feels intimidated in an airport. Obviously, you don't have to have an appointment to walk into the airport Hermes store. It's a way to get first time buyers into the fold, establish the relationship with them, and get them more comfortable in this buying experience, which is wholly unique to Hermes.
Ben: Yup. In some ways, it seems wholly on Hermes. But in other ways, the Apple watch thing that they do or the perfume, they are looking for ways to be more approachable.
David: Right.
Ben: Another one worth mentioning is employee turnover. The employees, especially the craftsmen, basically stay forever. As we've been saying, there's really no other game in town. If Hermes wasn't there, these people probably wouldn't have been trained to be craftsmen in the first place. What does that look like numerically? There is 6% annual turnover, and only 4.5% leave of their own desire. 4.5% of their entire workforce every year leaves of their own desire.
David: That translates to a longer than 20-year average tenure. This is like Costco level employment retention.
Ben: It's funny you say that. Costco is 7% a year, but Costco cheats a little bit and that the stat is after the first year, whereas Hermes is attrition of 6% and includes the first year.
David: Wow.
Ben: Yeah. Just compare this with all industries in the US, that's a 3.4% monthly turnover. In the United States across all industries, and thanks to Jeremy Diamond in the Slack for pointing this out, one third of the entire workforce churns on average every year. When you're trying to figure out, is 6% good? Six percent is unbelievable, because the benchmark is 33%.
David: Especially in the context of think about the two areas that are the bulk of Hermes' employees. It's craftspeople and sales associates.
Ben: Which if you are to use different language is manufacturing and retail, which are super high churn categories.
David: Right, that's the point I'm making.
Ben: Even software developers churn at 15%-20% per year, and that's just the voluntary numbers. This is much better than software engineers who get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to have a very cushy job. Finally, let's go real apples to apples. Let's compare this to LVMH.
LVMH is total turnover in 2022 was 24% versus Hermes' 6%. Hermes may be obsessed with this whole savoir faire, transmission of craft, and their annual report, but it is totally real. The entire thing works because of the knowledge and craft of their people.
David: They have incredible YouTube videos and documentaries. They put out like you referenced. You go see these people and you really feel, like factories. They're not factories. These ateliers are something truly unique.
Ben: Yeah, and they're only getting more obsessed with controlling everything end to end. Hermes used to have 56% of retail locations that were company owned. This is back in 2003, so 20 years ago. A little over half were company owned. That's now 74%. They're getting rid of what they refer to as the concessionaires, which are essentially franchise stores and closing them in favor of the wholly owned businesses.
Again, they're just trying to figure out, how do we control more of our production of our everything soup to nuts? They describe this strategy as having three pillars. This is three pillars for their entire business. This is the strategy at the top of the annual report. Creation, craftsmanship, and an exclusive distribution network. That's probably the way to sum up Hermes.
All right, to close playbook, I just have one more, which is really this idea of, what is the job to be done by Hermes? I had this great conversation with Derek Guy. He's colloquially known on Twitter as the menswear guy, @dieworkwear is his handle. He has some amazing threads. They're very worth reading about if you're interested in ironing pants or why suits don't fit the way they used to.
He pointed out this really interesting thing to me, which is the value propositions of Hermes are essentially a bundle. That bundle is exclusivity, service, craftsmanship, shopping experience, and a great brand. You basically can't get that bundle anywhere else. That doesn't have competitors.
David: Yeah, you can get individual elements of that bundle elsewhere.
Ben: Absolutely.
David: But by nature, given what this is in the luxury industry, you can't assemble this experience, the Hermes experience, out of separate components.
Ben: It used to exist. In a pre war, early 20th century era, you could. But Hermes was the only one that sort of chose to keep doing things the old way and scale, and everyone else kind of went out of business or changed their methodology to scale. For example, Louis Vuitton has the branding. They have exclusivity, but the craftsmanship isn't there. They don't make things in that early 20th century way.
Supreme can offer you exclusivity and brand, but again, there's no real craftsmanship there. You've got all these individual artisans, a craftsperson and a little workshop somewhere in Paris making the highest quality, Hermes quality things, but there's no brand. Would you buy that? Would you pay even half the price for that? I think a lot of people who are buying Hermes are buying it because it's Hermes. And they want the brand.
There are other things that are missing from that too. There's no shopping experience, service is unknown because you don't know how long that maker is going to be around. You know for a fact that 50 years from now, you can get your Hermes thing serviced. There's some great makers like Chester Mox, April in Paris, or I heard great things about Mila Jito. These are exceptional craftsmen, hand making items in the same way, but it's a different bundle of value propositions.
David: Yeah, completely different product.
Ben: To me, what sums up the analysis is that the magic of what Hermes has done is managed to scale the old way with the complete bundle.
David: Yup, totally agree. Nothing more to add.
Ben: Thanks, Charlie.
David: All right, should we do value creation capture, and then we've got a new way to wrap up episodes here?
Ben: Yes This section was originally created by us five years ago or something to basically assess of the value created in the world. How much does the company actually capture of it? Canonically, Craigslist creates a ton of value. Wikipedia creates a ton of value. It capture's very little of it. On the other hand, Google create a lot of value, you can find stuff on the internet. They're pretty damn good at capturing it. They've built a huge business on that.
There, I think, is a reasonable indictment to make that many of you will want to make on all of luxury and say, it's just excess, they don't actually create value in the world, and then they capture a tremendous amount of value because they just have a brand that allows people to social signal, and all luxury is excess. That's a reasonable viewpoint.
However, I think there's an interesting way to look at Hermes in particular, which is if what you desire is the highest quality craft they offer at an extreme price, a guarantee to be able to get that super high quality craft. That's different than every other luxury brand that is no longer about craftsmanship, but it's about hype and logos.
David: Brands. Let's bring up brand and fashion.
Ben: Yes. I would say, Hermes has figured out that there actually is a pretty big niche for craftsmanship or at least people who desire the brand of craftsmanship, and they're exceptional at value capture around that.
David: It's interesting. Yes, but the secondary market is this very direct, if you're talking purely about economic value creation, value capture. Very direct data point that, no, they are leaving a lot of surplus on the table for their consumers.
Ben: Another element to value creation, value capture is what they're doing good for the world, period, regardless of what they're able to capture. Anybody who's doing things with exotic leathers, you may have a problem with. Farmed crocodiles in mass quantities in order to create the Himalaya print Birkin bags
David: There's actually a brief period where Jane Birkin boycotted Hermes bags and asked them to take her name off of them.
Ben: Do you know how that got solved? Why is she cool with it now?
David: I could be wrong, but I believe this is when Hermes took the crocodile farming in-house and improved a lot of the animal welfare standards.
Ben: For everyone who's like, it's absolutely cruel to do this to crocodiles, to make handbags, Hermes doesn't really have a counterpoint. They don't have like a, well, they live good lives. That's not a part of their defense. Their defense is purely around sustainable farming, which is, hey, these are endangered species in many scenarios with these exotic leathers. What we do is for the ones that we farm, we also release a bunch into the wild to try to replenish the population.
Even though we're not actually taking away from the population in the wild because we're not hunting them, we are trying to, almost in an eye for an eye way, say, look, we're creating a bunch of crocodiles, so we're releasing a bunch of them into nature also. I don't know, it sits medium with me.
David: Yeah. It's not a great response.
Ben: Right. Similarly, you see piles and piles and piles of cow hides for the leather production. The response is, well, look, these were beef cows, so we're basically doing. a good thing by making sure that we use the whole animal since we were going to use it anyway for sustenance somewhere else in humanity.
David: To me, that is a better argument than we farm the crocodiles for the skins. It's funny. Actually, doing the Novo Nordisk episode gave me a new perspective on this with animal products, and obviously insulin doesn't come from animals anymore. It's genetically engineered, but a lot of pigs and cows went into producing insulin for many many many decades. That's a new perspective to look at things because people would have died otherwise. Is that what's happening here with Hermes? Absolutely not.
Ben: Right. Other brands, Chanel, Karl Lagerfeld, Mulberry, a bunch of them are banning exotic leathers in their products. I think Hermes has played around with mushroom leather, but do I think Hermes is going to go all vegan anytime soon? Absolutely not. It's just not happening.
The last thing that you can definitely be mad about if you are into animal welfare is the fact that Hermes cares so deeply about their brand that they burn imperfect products so they never see the light of day. That's a bummer. I understand Hermes' position of not wanting these bags to get out there and have their brand on it. People realize, oh, some Birkin bags look crappy. But if you're destroying product that could otherwise have utility, especially when it's made from animals, bummer.
David: Agreed.
Ben: They spend a lot of time in their annual report talking about how much more they're getting efficient in their manufacturing processes, how the rates of this are going down. They don't specifically call out burning bags, but how they're able to use more and more of the raw material and have everything that goes in the top of the funnel get used in products all the way at the bottom of the funnel. The company has taken a lot of heat for it over the years, and it's something that they spend a lot of time working on.
All right. David, I think that brings us to the question, which is, what is your big takeaway from this episode? What is a big idea you're obsessed with after spending all this time with Hermes?
David: We've been struggling for a while with, how do we end these episodes, these books that we're in right now?
Ben: Right, we're not going to grade them the way that we used to grade.
David: Right, that doesn't make sense. That was always hokey anyway. We've done bear case and bull case. Again, are we going to do that better than an equity research analyst? I don't know.
Ben: Importantly, bear case bull case has to take into account what people's current expectations, so you have to dissect the stock price.
David: Right, which isn't really the point of Acquired.
Ben: Right. We figure by the time you get to this point of the episode, you already have a bear case and a bull case in your head. It's not like we're going to sit here and paint, well, if people keep being excited about luxury goods...
David: Here's an incredible new insight that will change your perspective on the stock. No.
Ben: Right.
David: We've been casting about for honestly a while here of like, how do we land the plane on these episodes? What we're trying here for the first time, and let us know what you think if you like it, is in a very Hermes like way, we dedicate really a month plus of our life to each of these episodes. This is all we're doing for certainly the last four weeks. Every day we've been getting up, we've been studying this company, we've been writing. It's insane.
Ben: It's craft. We joke, but it's craft.
David: Really, like you said, Ben, this episode started a year ago when we did the LVMH episode, and it's been percolating and percolating and percolating. The last four weeks, it's been every waking moment for us. I think a fun way to try to end the episode is when we wake up in the middle of the night and Hermes is on our mind, what are the aspects of Hermes and why?
It ends up being personal for us. What resonates for us from having told this story, done this work, and what resonates for Acquired, honestly? For me, we've touched on this a little bit throughout the episode with the whimsy and the dream element of Hermes, but there's something also to this company that I think is deeply interconnected with the fact that it's on the sixth generation of the family.
You ask yourself, how is that possible? How six generations later is this company stronger than ever, and the family members are more committed than ever to running it? I think it's because they have fun. Again, this comes through in the whimsy. This comes through in the annual reports. This comes through when you watch the interviews with Axel and Pierre-Alexis, when you read the articles, and hear people talk like Beatrice about Jean-Louis, they are really having fun doing what they're doing.
It's an amazing culture, and it's hard to have in an environment where you are also, I think, the 47th largest market cap company in the world. I think about other companies, it's about winning. You think about a professional sports team. I think my mind goes to like the New England Patriots. Honestly, it goes to like Benchmark and Sequoia, like the best venture capital firms out there. These are organizations that are 100% dedicated to winning. It's not that Hermes isn't dedicated to winning, but they're even more so dedicated to having fun and enjoying themselves.
Ben: Yeah. They’re fun and they're staying true to their identity. Both of those things are more important than winning some numerical game.
David: Right. For me, that's the splinter in my mind over the last set of months with Hermes. Honestly, it's what acquired is for me and for us. Hermes could go out tomorrow and they could follow the consultants. They could borrow a page from the LVMH playbook, and they could vastly increase their sales and profitability overnight. If they were solely focused on winning, that might be what they do, but they are never going to do that.
Ben: But if they do that, it's still only a short term right thing to do.
David: Right. I think it's tied into this short term, long term perspective thing. The reason I say it's fun is the family wants to keep doing this. If it weren't fun, they would probably maximize value, they would hit the short term bid, and they would sell to Bernard. But they don't.
Ben: Yup, I love that. The splinter in my mind is that you can sell what on the face of it seems like the same type of products as someone else, but build two entirely different businesses. Louis Vuitton and Hermes, on the face of it, do the same thing. As soon as you start digging in, you realize that these companies could not be more different. All of the puzzle pieces that fit together to create Hermes is an entirely different puzzle than the pieces that fit together to create Louis Vuitton.
It's a great reminder that just because you are in the same product category as someone else, you don't have to build a similar business, and you might not even be competing with them. There's a large number of people for whom Louis Vuitton and Hermes are not actually in a consideration set together ever. I think that's fascinating.
David: Right. These are Mutually exclusive brands for a lot of people. Certainly not all, but a lot of people. I was thinking about that too a little bit in the context of, oftentimes in a market, the best way to compete with your best competitor is to do the exact opposite of them, it's not to compete with them.
Ben: Or at least be open to a, we don't have to do anything alike. Open to that idea.
David: Right. This is Android and iOS.
Ben: Right.
David: All right. That's our landing of the Hermes plane. Let us know what you think. I just love doing this one. This was one of the most enjoyable experiences for me. All of our episodes are, but I just really loved this one.
Ben: Sometimes we get to learn about an industry that's interesting to know things about like healthcare or something we're a fan of, like the NFL episode. But sometimes we do an episode like Hermes and it really teaches us how to run our own business. Again, Acquired is not luxury, but we do create a product that has real scarcity, both on the listener front, because we only have an episode a month and on the sponsor front, because we only have three sponsors a season. There is so much to learn studying the purity of Hermes when you run a business that's predicated on scarcity.
David: Yes.
Ben: This one was extra indulgent for you and I.
David: Yes, totally. Okay, carveouts. Let's do it. What you got?
Ben: I have three.
David: Fun.
Ben: And none of them are a Vision Pro, even though the Vision Pro is sitting next to me on my desk. The reason is not because I can't recommend it, but because this is Acquired, and we can't possibly do anything that's too current. I need more time to evaluate.
David: The Hermes of podcast indeed.
Ben: Okay. First one, the Anker Prime charger. I'll give you the model number, because Anker products are impossible to figure out what's what. This is the A2343 model. It is a 100-watt charger that has two USB C ports and one USB A port, and it is tiny. It's lightweight. It's dense. You'll pick it up and be like, oh, my God, this is really heavy, but it's lightweight compared to large bricks.
Here's the important thing. In those diagonal airline charging seats, you can plug it in and it doesn't fall out. It's a hundred watts. You can super fast charge phone, laptop, whatever. There are two ports, two USB ports and one USB A, and it works on airlines. It's the only thing that I travel with now. It's the new gallium nitride GAN charging technology, which I think is totally game changing.
David: Nice. I've got a 60-watt Anker that is same concept. Totally, the  only thing I travel with.
Ben: Is it gallium nitride?
David: No, it's a few years old.
Ben: Okay, yeah. I don't understand why nobody's talking about it, because it feels like it completely revolutionized chargers. It makes everything 50% the size, even though it has super high power delivery.
David: I might need to upgrade my travel setup. Maybe I need an Hermes leather case for it.
Ben: Might need to do it. All right, we'll link it in the show notes. Two more are apps, websites, or web services. I don't know what we're supposed to call them these days. The first one is an app called Matter, which I have replaced. For years, I used Instapaper. It was great, but it just hasn't been touched in forever.
Matter is Instapaper but better. It is also an amazing way to listen to things that you save in a very realistic voice. Long time listeners know, I don't absorb stuff very well by reading. I absorb it really well by listening.
David: You're talking about text to speech, not saving podcast episodes.
Ben: Correct. You can save podcast episodes, but you can forward an email newsletter and have that read it to you. You can use the bookmarklet on a website and have it read it to you. It bundles in text to speech, podcasts, email newsletters, and read it later type services into one app. I did half the research for this by taking long things to read including PDFs. It has an ability to parse PDFs now and listening while running.
My son was asleep in a carrier and I'm walking around the house, I'm in a dark room somewhere, or I'm on the treadmill in the garage. I really like Matter. The team behind it is awesome. They actually were kind enough to reach out and have David and I collaborate with them on a couple of guest blog posts for their Words that Matter series of some of our favorite readings and writings of all time. The team was great, which was my entree into it, but the product has exceeded expectations.
David: Okay. I haven't actually tried the app yet. I love those guys, now I got to try the app.
Ben: It's awesome. My third one is another thing that dramatically has helped my research, which is Perplexity AI.
David: Yeah.
Ben: If I could stop using Google, I would, because Perplexity is better for everything that I use to Google, period.
David: Wow, okay. All right, we got to have Perplexity on ACQ2 or something. More to come on this.
Ben: It's all the good things about ChatGPT, all the good things about Google, and none of the bad things of either. It's reliable, it links to sources, it has good UI. I trust it because I've fact checked it so many times, and it just keeps being right. It makes it easy to fact check. Accessing information is one of these things that if it's 97% good, it's bad. So it needs to be always good.
David: Honestly, this is why I don't use ChatGPT for acquired work, I feel like we need to be a hundred percent all the time.
Ben: Here's the best use case for perplexity. The other day, I couldn't find something on Google. I went over to perplexity, I asked it the question, and it said, the answer to this is unknown on the internet. I was like, that is amazing. You just gave me confidence.
David: Getting that answer. Otherwise, you're going to spend half an hour on Google trying to find it.
Ben: Yes.
David: That's amazing.
Ben: It was both time saving and confidence inducing.
David: I love it. Okay. I've heard from so many people about Perplexity. I got to give it a go in the next episode research.
Ben: It's phenomenal.
David: I'm so disappointed in myself, but also it's just the reality of my life right now. I've become the middle of the bell curve technology adopter. I used to be the bleeding edge early adopter. Man, getting old is hard. Joanna Stern had a great quote about this in the Wall Street Journal, and she was interviewed by Ben Thompson recently. She said, "Man, I wish I had the access that I have now when I was younger." I would be unstoppable pulling all nighters. I'd be using it to its full degree. I don't have the energy now. I got kids. I'm like, man, I feel that.
Ben: That's the paradox. You often do your best work when you get older, even though you have less time because you're wiser, your information's better.
David: Your access, everything.
Ben: Yeah. You've gotten better at your craft. You can never have both, but you live your life anyway. You'll make it through.
David: What's the Dune quote? Life is not a problem to solve, but a reality to experience.
Ben: Yeah, I think that is it.
David: There you go. Okay, my carve out. We are recording this. By the time the episode comes out, the Super Bowl will have been played and won by somebody. Man, I am fired up. Go Niners, San Francisco 49ers, Brock Purdy. Hell yeah. I'm channeling my inner JT O'Sullivan and QB School YouTube channel here. I'm so excited. Brock's story is amazing. I was trying to think, okay, I can't have the Niners and the Super Bowl be my carve out.
Ben: Especially if this airs after they lose. Are we leaving it in?
David: Right, especially if they lose. But what I can have as my carve out and is perfect for Acquired, years ago, I read Bill Walsh's book. Bill Walsh was the legendary coach of the 49ers during the Joe Montana, Steve Young era. He invented the West Coast offense. He wrote this book called The Score Takes Care of Itself, and it's so good. It's just like a great leadership book, but the title says it all.
It's related to Hermes, it's related to Acquired. It's the splinter in the mind, everything we've been talking about. It includes some ideas like scripting. This is now so commonplace in the NFL and football everywhere, but everybody scripts out your first set of 5, 10, 20 plays, et cetera. Bill Walsh invented that. We do the same thing on Acquired. We have scripts, I have a script, and you have a script. Obviously, the episode doesn't follow the script any more than an NFL game.
Ben: But you need a way to start that's predictable or at least something you've thought through.
David: Right. Obviously, Bill Walsh didn't invent that idea writ large, but he invented it for the NFL. There's also some really good stuff in there about when to persist with doing something different and continue to do it versus stop doing it, and what are the right reasons to do it? Especially in the early days when it's working or not working, I'm thinking about launching the Birkin and all that. Anyway, it's a great book. Bill Walsh was a legendary figure. Go Niners. Hell yeah.
Ben: There you go. Wishing you the best of luck. Listeners, you know it already happened.
David: Either way, I'm celebrating because either the Niners won, or we're going to see a lot of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, so I'm thrilled.
Ben: I tweeted this that Taylor plus the NFL is literally the perfect bundle, because they've both fully saturated their markets that Taylor is America's musical cultural icon of this moment. There's no one who could be a Taylor superfan. That's not already a Taylor superfan. The NFL similarly has had close to a hundred year history, and it is the fullest realization of itself already. The NFL is America's sport, so they've already got all the superfans they're going to get. By bundling together, this is so awful.
David: No, this is the ultimate collab.
Ben: Yes. They can address each other as casual fans who wouldn't have tuned in specifically for one or the other.
David: Taylor is a hundred percent thing. I'm not saying she's dating Travis because of this, but Taylor is one of the smartest CEOs in the world, writ large, period, bar none. Of course, she's thinking about this.
Ben: Yup. What's the phrase that Shishir Mehrotra used? The marginal churn contribution. There are people who will not turn off the Super Bowl who otherwise would have because there might be another Taylor viewing.
David: Jenny has negative interest in football, but she's telling me about what Taylor is wearing, whether she's going to be able to make it back from Japan from the Super Bowl.
Ben: We'll see. All right, listeners, we have a bunch of thank yous. Huge thank you to Domenico De Sole, the former CEO of Gucci and the co-founder of Tom Ford with Tom Ford. Domenico, your conversation was just invaluable in preparing for this episode, and obviously, yes, a legend. Adam Pritzker, a good friend of the show, is the co-founder of Assembled Brands and the company Kate, which is in the fashion and luxury space. Adam is Super kind and a huge contributor to this episode, just like he was to LVMH.
To Derek Guy, who is @dieworkwear on Twitter for teaching me about saddle stitching, what makes Hermes special, and a bunch of the other brands that we mentioned that do boutique leather goods, and for putting April in Paris on my radar. That was very helpful. Reginald-Jerome de Mans or RJ, which is a funny pen name, he wrote a book called Swan Songs: Souvenirs of Paris Elegance. He's obsessed, for lack of a better phrase, with Parisian luxury and the history of it. It was really educational to talk with him about this and fact check a lot of my Hermes history.
Finally, there is a lot written about the company. I do think the best way to understand Hermes is just to go right to the source. There are 586-page annual report. They just lay out the whole strategy. If you're curious about the company, that's an amazing place to look.
David: It's funny, we did not talk to anyone at the company we'd usually never do when we're making an episode.
Ben: It's just awkward.
David: Yeah. We usually talk to them afterwards, but not during. In this case, we didn't need to. It's right there. They wrote down everything.
Ben: Yup. David, I know you had a couple of cool conversations.
David: Yeah. Speaking of April in Paris, Beatrice Amblard here in San Francisco, was so fun to talk to, an actual former Hermes artisan. There's personal stories of Jean-Louis and the family. They really gave me a sense of just how special the family is, the company is, and the work that they do.
I also have to think Lauren Sherman. Lauren is, I think, pretty much bar none, the very best business of fashion and business of luxury reporter out there. She was at the business of fashion for a long time. She's now at Puck. She's Puck's fashion correspondent. She launched the fashion vertical for Puck.
Lauren is awesome. I chatted with her for a long time. She gave me a lot of great perspective on Hermes within the industry. Really, there are a few journalists out there. I'm thinking of Brad Stone, Emily Chang at Bloomberg, and Kara Swisher obviously, but they're incredible journalists. They really, really understand the business and the industry that they're covering, and Lauren is one of those. It was super great to get to chat with her.

Introduction
Patrick
Today's Breakdown has been at the top of our to-do list since the show started. There are a few 
brands as strong as this one, and the way that Dumas family has nurtured it over the last 6 
generations is remarkable. We are, of course, talking about one of the ultimate status symbols 
Hermès. What began as a specialty sales business in the mid-1850s has become famous for 
iconic handbags and other luxury items.

Last year, the business earned $9 billion at 70% gross margins. It does things differently and to 
explore the details behind its difference, I'm joined by a long-time shareholder, Mark Urquhart. 
Mark is a partner at Baillie Gifford and Head of their long-term global growth team, which he co-
founded in 2003. Hermès was in the original portfolio when it launched in 2004 and has been 
held their since. Please enjoy this breakdown of Hermès.

The Famous Birkin Bag
Patrick
So Mark, this is going to be such a fun conversation, and I was toying with where to begin. And 
since I just this morning learned really what a Birkin bag is with some astonishment, maybe you 
can start there. Can you explain this iconic product? I think it's a nice way to begin a 
conversation about such a storied and incredible brand.

Mark
Sure. Thanks for having me. I guess with Hermès, there's these 2 über bags, the Birkin and 
the Kelly. They both have similar yet slightly different histories. So the Kelly actually 
predated Grace Kelly using it by 20 years.

I think it was called the Sac a Depeches in the late 1930s, but she was famously pictured 
holding it, I think, in 1956. The hypocritical story I don't know is that it was to hide her being 
pregnant. So it is quite substantial bag.

And at a time when I guess the paparazzi and the press wrote everything. She was 
obviously a huge icon at the time and glamorous and was pictured with it, and so it became 
autonomously known as the Kelly since then. And then similar genesis with the Birkin where 
Jane Birkin, where it comes from, again, a huge Hollywood star as her name, and she 
became associated as one of the first users of that bag.

And they both kind of lasted, we're now talking, multiple decades, which is astonishing 
really. The Birkin is actually slightly more expensive off-the-shelf, and they're are both 
hugely expensive bags. But interestingly, the Kelly, I was doing a little bit of playing around 
just to get the resale values, quite often the Kellys have substantially higher resale value, 
which is a bit of an interesting quirk.

The important thing is you get multiple colors, multiple materials, but stylistically, they are 
exactly the same. So they haven't altered. And I'm sure we'll get into this, but lots of luxury 
companies revamp their designs due to different things to try to keep the light up fresh. But 
these things, if you put a vintage one side by side with one bought this year, you would 
know that they're the same bag.

Patrick
Just to really hit the point home, how much do they sell for new and say a bit about resale 
values as well?

Mark
So the Birkin, the cheapest Birkin you could get is about USD 8,500. They go up massively 
from there. It depends on the skin and the complexity of the manufacturer. Very rare 
crocodile might sell for into 6 figures.

And they are too discrete to sort of publicize what these sell for Kelly, a little bit less than 
that. You might get an entry-level Kelly for USD 6,500, USD 7,000. Resale value, it really 
depends on many factors, actually.

So year can be quite important, a bit like vintage cars, I guess, which is somewhat 
counterintuitive when you think they're the same all the time. But it seems to be on if there's 
been particular celebrities associated with that year, then you get some very classic colors 
with a kind of tans or the blacks. Obviously, some people go for that.

Some people will go for much more exotic colors, so there have been. I'll get some of the 
modern cultural references wrong, but the kind of Cardi Bs and Beyonces and others who 
had been seen with them, they'll go for much more lurid bright colors. So the resale values 
can be triple, quadruple, so up into the USD 25,000, USD 30,000. So these are…

Patrick
Incredibly expensive.

Mark
Incredibly expensive and also investment pieces, which is interesting in itself when you're 
purchasing an article.

Patrick
We're going to talk a lot today about both product and distribution because in luxury, both 
categories are almost as interesting. I mean, obviously, the product probably gets most of the 
attention, but the distribution is totally fascinating. It's a big part about what makes the 
business. Maybe just as a teaser of the distribution, why when I went online this morning to look 
at one of these things could I not see one on their website. And the only thing I could see when 
I went to the bag section was straps for the bags. That's the only thing I was able to buy online. 
Why is that?

Mark
They don't have a complex algorithm that's stopping you buying one. These are an 
experience. Unlike quite a lot of the rest of the industry, which especially during COVID and 
even pre-COVID, has started to move online, Hermès is very much an experiential. You 
come to the shop. It's a real ceremony to get these bags.

Obviously, I'm sure we'll delve into the waiting list, the actual process of becoming a bag 
owner online for Hermès is about the size of one of their substantial shops. It's low-single 
digits in terms of revenue to really what they're doing online. They'll sell some man bags 
because basically we are not that interesting to them. You can get a couple of nice ties. 
There'll be some silk scars.

They use it really as another shop front but are at the extreme end of the industry in 
resisting that move to online. And for them, it's because they want this to be, the French 
would say, recherché, almost sort of hard to access, hard to get.

A big part of acquiring this bag is having your appointment in Rue du Faubourg, which is the 
flagship store in Paris or in Bond Street or Madison Avenue, choose your location. It's not 
just a pop-in and here's your bag, Patrick. You're good to go. It will be 1.5 hours. There will be 
champagne or it will be tea and cake, and it's the unveiling and the unwrapping. It's a really 
important part of their brand management that you can't just pop on and order one for 
Christmas.

The Business Model
Patrick
Give us a sense for the scale of this business. Obviously, they're incredibly famous for these 
bags, but they have products in lots of different categories. They’re are sort of interesting 
structure in that the family is a key part of the story. We're going to get into the whole story in 
just a minute here. But maybe you could just level set for the audience, the scope and scale of 
the business itself today in 2022.

Mark
So the last year, they did just shy of EUR 9 billion of revenue. We've owned it for around 20 
years. When we first bought it back in the early 2000s, that was about EUR 1.2 billion, EUR 
1.3 billion. So a substantial growth, about 50% of the business is leather goods, a huge part 
of the profitability.

Like a lot of luxury companies, they have a ready-to-wear business. They are sort of extreme 
fashion, that means nothing to my sort of untrained Scottish eye, but it's an interesting part 
of the brand, that's about 20%. Actually, interestingly, historically, silks through a period and 
part of what interests me is so much about Hermès is how it has pivoted several times 
through its history.

So in the '20, '30s, silks were the mainstay of the business, and it’s also been famous. I 
wouldn't say as famous for its scarves, but very well known, and you meet particularly 
French women of a certain age, and they will almost undoubtedly be wearing a Hermès 
scarf. It's just part of the uniform. And that's another 15%, 20% of the business, and then 
there's the usual entry-level stuff, perfumes, trying to get people into the brand. That's 
about 5%, 6% of the business. The majority or half is leather goods and then the rest is 
made up of those other elements.

Patrick
What about some of the basics around the margin structure of the business? Typically, luxury 
has very high margins. What does that look like for Hermès and anything interesting relative to 
other luxury companies that you would point out about the financials, let's call it?

Mark
That, to me, is a huge fan of this company, so I have hold it for so long, but a lot of it is 
based on the margin structure. So operating margins last year, 40%. If you look to this 
business and didn't know what it did, it looks like a software business as sort of 70% gross 
margins, 40% operating margins, you would not think that this is a manufacturing business.

It's got no right to kind of earn those margins. That ties back into where we started, that 
they are able to command this premium pricing on these bags, but not just on the bags 
throughout the categories. So if you look at a Hermès tie, which is very nice, I've treated 
myself to a couple over the years. It's sort of hard for a Scotsman to stomach the luxury 
price tags. But every 10 years or so I kind of break and buy one. They're nice ties, don't get 
me wrong, but they're still ties.

I could easily buy one at a 1/5 of the price, but there's something about having is that 
intangible Hermès. So throughout the categories, they're really profitable. They're very 
careful about how they reinvest. So one of the features I didn't answer your question on the 
family ownership, they would describe themselves as stewards of the business. They are 
passing this business over onto the sixth generation now from the 1830s of family 
involvement.

It's well over half of the shares are privately owned. I think there's something like 23, 24 
different sections of the family, and they're very careful about the allocation. Unlike other 
luxury brands, they haven't really been involved in the M&A game at all. They've bought 1 or 
2 suppliers of raw materials, but it's a mono-brand. There's no sort of second act to Hermès. 
They're extremely good stewards of capital.

The debate we've had internally over the years is, are these margins sustainable, why can't 
someone else come in at a 10% discount with as good a bag and compete that way. And 
that to me is the beauty of the business that you just can't.

Patrick
Luxury is so interesting because it's so confounding as a business. It's almost an embarrassment 
of things that we have to talk about today. We will get to all of them. But before we do get into 
some of the details, I think it's probably appropriate to ask this question earlier than I normally 
would, which is around defensibility.

If you think about some of the business school ideas for competitive advantage or you think 
about something like competitive advantage period, let's say, for a software business, what you 
find is that even the very best companies for the most part have some period of time during 
which they earn abnormally high returns and it sort of gets competed away even in the 
presence of moats.

We're talking right after ChatGPT came out and everyone is now saying, "Oh, Google is in 
trouble," even though Google seemed to have the greatest business moat of all time. Talk about 
why something like Hermès is like the ultimate in your mind in defensibility of a business that 
can potentially sustain those incredibly high operating margins?

Mark
I think you've hit the nail firmly on the head that that's the nub of the investment case. It 
makes no rational sense. I think that's really important that people have tried hundreds of 
different strategies. They've tried to say this is as good a bag. This leather is as good, it's 
made by similar artisans that make the Hermès bags. They've tried pricing above Hermès to 
almost give it that über attraction. They tried pricing at the same level. They've tried pricing 
just below.

And that to me gets to the very defensibility to your question of the brand, the fact that 
they have these two iconic handbags that simply can't be challenged. I've tried this many 
times over the years to female colleagues of different ages. If I gave you the option to buy 
any handbag, what would it be, I would say 90% plus will always say a Birkin or a Kelly, and

that in a nutshell is what the competition they are up against.

So economic theory suggests a business like this, there's no shortage of capital to come in. 
As you said, there's huge margin structure to attack, and rationally, it should sort of flood in, 
but they're not substitutes. They are substitutes in the sense that a handbag is something 
you keep or you c*** it. I'm judging from my wife, it's functional, but it's way beyond 
functional.

So there is something intrinsically special there. And to me, that's the heritage, it's the 
craftsmanship, it's the image. It's the fact that they themselves are so careful about how 
they grow this, and there's no sort of glut of supply because the other thing that a lot of 
companies would do, which say, "Oh, my goodness, we've got such demand here, we can 
change our production process a little bit. Let's flood the market and maximize short-term 
revenues". That doesn't happen.

change our production process a little bit. Let's flood the market and maximize short-term 
revenues". That doesn't happen.

So there's a whole myriad interaction of small competitive advantages that must frustrate 
the hell out of competition actually. We speak a lot to different luxury companies. We own 
shares in Kering as well, which obviously has Gucci, which is reasonably high end, but it's 
kind of different.

Chanel might be the closest competitor. It's obviously privately owned, so it's harder to get 
a read on them, but Chanel has an absolutely fabulous brand, but it's not Hermès, and 
they're not quite competing. So it's really -- intellectually, it's fascinating why there isn't 
those threats to the durability, one that we might comeback to is ultimate size, how big can 
a luxury brand get, and I've got quite a lot of thoughts on that.

Patrick
Oh, yes, maybe just go there now because there was an example that I read in preparation that I 
can't remember what the name of the product was, but there was some product that was 
selling too well, and they just completely discontinued it.

Maybe talk a bit about the metered growth and ultimate size that you just mentioned of what 
this could become because when you think about it with your investment hat on, if you can say 
at 40% of margins, you'd love that EUR 9 billion to become EUR 90 billion. Talk about the 
potential growth, ultimate market size, all your thoughts there with any examples that you think 
are relevant.

Mark
Back when we were first investing in luxury brands 20 years ago as a strategy I set up. At 
that stage, out of the far distance was this EUR 10 billion bigger. There was no brand that 
was there yet. Now, there are several, that catch phrase I said, Hermès is about EUR 1 billion 
below that. LV, the actual Louis Vuitton part of LVMH, Chanel, the best estimates are 
somewhere around there.

The question is, is there a trade-off between growth, and there's nowhere near ubiquitous 
overall Hermès is about 4% of the luxury market. It depends obviously on how you define it, 

Business Breakdowns - Hermès: The Luxury Icon

maybe close to double digits of the leather part of that.

But there is this worry that, well, hang on a minute, if everyone has one of these things, 
surely you lose the exclusivity that is part of the cache. The interesting counter example to 
that is Louis Vuitton in Japan, which is a podcast in itself probably for someone else to talk 
to you about, but there's something like 40 million Louis Viton handbags in Japan.

And many of those are just the one that as soon as I say it, you will think of the initials, the 
monographs, the LV or the brown bag and you go on to Tokyo subway and everyone has 
got one. But that's okay. Everyone wants one. I don't think Hermès will ever get there, and 
it's quite interesting. You have to know that it's a Hermès bag.

One of the things that is interesting about it is it's not particularly monogrammed. It's not 
very flashy. You have to know to know sort of thing. And the other thing that's happened in 
the market is go back 20 years, the luxury market, and this is something most management 
teams across the industry will talk about has changed quite radically.

Obviously, there's been huge growth of China. Again, I'm sure we'll come back to that and 
debate where that might go. There's been cycles within that, obviously, based on the 
Communist Party clampdown. But generally, that's been a massive thing.

But interestingly, the Middle East, topically at the moment, obviously, Qatar hosting the 
World Cup, but anyone who travels through the Middle East through Qatar through Dubai, 
the UAE, and increasingly, actually, Saudi Arabia, those are big markets. There is a lot of, 
obviously, wealth in those regions and people who want to display some of that in this very 
high-end way.

But I find what that really interests me about is actually the U.S. market. The U.S. has been a 
bit of an anomaly in the luxury market. There's been some quite strong growth on the East 
and West Coast, but in the flyover states less so, and luxury was sold in quite a funny way 
through that Neiman Marcus’ or the Saks of the world and the concession.

So it actually comes back to one of the topics you raised earlier in terms of distribution, but 
you're starting to see stand-alone stores coming more commonly in the U.S., more 
connection directly with the brands. So it's not just the China story that you're jumping 
companies slightly, but Mr. Pinault at Kering has talked about having all these different legs 
of growth in the luxury market.

His father founded the business and passed it on to him. And back then, it was probably 
East Coast U.S., capital cities of Europe, and Japan 20 years ago. Now, there's a lot more 
markets. So putting that all together, I think this can get to my time period is 10 years plus in 
terms of how I invest. I see no reason why it can’t at least double sales from here and sort of 
carry on and one of the attractions is that it has that intrinsic growth.

Coming back to the second part of that, about how they control the brand, the story you're 
referring to is one of my favorites on Hermès, which is they had a hit beach bag off their 
hands. This is going back 15 years or so ago. And it was again led by Tokyo, this is just sort of 
one of these canvas bags. Being Hermès, it wasn’t just a canvas bag. It was like $150 or 
something and flying off the shelves in Japan, 99.9% of management teams where they saw 
that the reaction is...

Patrick
Double down, get more bags.

Mark
Double down, get more bags, where can we source these, let's get these out, let's exploit 
this, exactly the opposite to Hermès. They were like, this is not what we want. We need to 
take the stock off the shelves, let's destroy it. We don't even want to discount this. This is 
not what we are about. We are not about having ubiquity and having that faddishness to it. 
We are classics.

And I think the great part of the story is that the CEO was telling me about this, Patrick 
Thomas, he was the predecessor of Axel Dumas. I remember at the end of the story, he sort 
of said, oh, and of course, we then went to the Board and reported this, and you might think 
some Boards are, you know that's irrational. What are you doing? And the Board just gave 
them a standing ovation just sort of, “Yes, yes, well done, guys, that's the right decision”. To 
me, that gets to the real DNA of the company, how they think about the brand.

History & Heritage
Patrick
Yes. Maybe it's the right time then to talk about a word you mentioned earlier, which is heritage. 
It seems like one of the things that's hardest to disrupt in some of these luxury brands is literally 
just time that if properly managed, and we'll talk about how they manage the family and the 
company manage the brand and the consistency and the evolution through time, but it's 
impossible to substitute it as this was started in the early 1800s.

And while there are some examples like Brunello Cucinelli or something of high-end luxury 
brands that are more recent, many of them are very, very old. And there's something to the 
timelessness and the history and the heritage that lights people's brains on fire for whatever 
reason, like you said, not necessarily rational in terms of its utility. But I think it's really important 
for you to dive into Hermès’ history, which all started with a horse.

Mark
That to me, if you were to really break it down and say, what can be replicated here is that 
the story was it started as a saddle maker back in the 1830s, horses were one of the main 
ways to get around and made exquisite saddlery and had a high-end reputation even from 
the very beginning, which I think is important. As the century dawned, the rise of the 
automobile, they were faced with quite a large existential threat, and saddles became less 
functional and more of a past time, so it carried on in a smaller way.

So that's where they started to use some of the skills that have been acquired. And 
importantly, it's always been French artisans who had made these goods. That's another 
strategic choice, which they take that is very different. So you have approaching 200 years 
of heritage. And every time they communicate the emblem of Hermès is that equestrian 
heritage.

Their press releases are quite unique in the sense that almost talking about the short term is 
vulgar, when they report quarterly results, there's always a long-term tone to them. And it 
just seeks through the business. I would 100% agree with you that there are some newer 
brands that look really interesting, but they've not yet stood the test of time. With Cucinelli, 
in the next 10, 20 years, we'll have a leadership change there, and that will be quite 
interesting because it's obviously built around the economist founder there.

Several years ago, I was sort of challenging myself. So I did look at some of the newer

brands. At that time, Michael Kors was lighting things up. And I felt, okay, I'm going to do a 
research process on Michael Kors. It just didn't compare. It did a decent job with the kind of 
entry-level bags that you could almost tell it was just that firework brand based around his 
personality, his TV shows.

And it just had a very, very different feel and a different vibe to it. I think it's been hard over 
the years. There's been several, several efforts. There's been Coach obviously on your side 
of the pond. There's been Tod's in Europe. And the other thing is it gives us a playbook that 
you can go back and go back to the library. So that's something we have seen a little in 
Gucci more recently, which going slightly off topic on Hermès, but hopefully, it's 
interesting.

Gucci is to me one of the ultimate indestructible brands. You've had murder, you've had 
divorces, it's the Italian stereotype. It's like the godfather of the leather industry. And then, 
Alessandro Michele came in a few years ago. He just recently announced that he's leaving. 
He just basically went back through the bag catalog and said we've got these symbols that 
are Gucci history, we could use them again, and I love that about these brands that they 
have a competitive advantage that even through capital you can't replicate.

As you said, it's time, it's heritage. I think there's something about them being European. 
There is that kind of real specialness about the French and Italian brands. I did the Japanese 
market for several years, and it always interested me that Japan -- you would say that Japan 
almost has the ultimate cultural backdrop of extreme craftsmanship and attention to detail 
and why haven't they been able to create. Surely, there must be a story of someone on the 
far side of Mount Fuji, he's been making goods for 200 hundred years…

Patrick
And some of the oldest companies in the world are Japanese.

Mark
Some of the oldest companies, but they haven't. And likewise, China, there's no evidence 
that China is producing…

Patrick
Why? What's your explanation for this?

Mark
I've thought about it long and hard. It seems to be there is something about buying 
European heritage. So there's something about that Parisian or the Milanese and part of it is 
as anyone who's visited those streets there are these extremely beautiful streets and old 
buildings with wonderful shop fronts and they just feel luxurious. It's always that you're 
choosing to buy part of that history by owning this item, you are part of this long lineage, 
which is, again, seems slightly irrational. But that's the kind of beauty of it.

Patrick
No one could see us on Zoom. We've got two poorly dressed unfashionable dudes talking about 
this, maybe the wrong pair to be figuring this out. It still raises the question for me of what to 
you luxury is and means because it's like one of these words like you kind of know what it 
means, but I like the way you just described it that what you're buying here is not the utility of 
the bag, but a piece of history or a piece of a vibe.

I'm curious how deep you've gone into the consumer psychology here. When someone buys 
one of these bags or a luxury good in general, what is the job being done? Is it about signaling? 
Is it about signaling wealth? How do you think about the motivation behind these purchases, 
which show up as 40% operating margins, like obviously something there is unique that's going 
on? It's a big question, but like to you just big picture, what is luxury, like why is this such a 
thing?

Mark
Yes, it's something we've tried to understand over 20 years. If you go back to the derivation 
of the word luxury that comes from the Latin luxe, L-U-X-E, and in Roman times, even 
predating Roman really and Greek society and Egyptian society of what we know, there was 
always a desire -- I think the best phrase is just sort of show off. That whole idea of 
luxuriating is saying, "Yes, I've got some status here. I'm part of this club”. It's not always in a 
flashy way, and I think that's quite important. I think there would be much less good 
businesses if this is only about bling.

There's definitely an element of that. And one of the interesting areas is how luxury has 
become very associated with some of the rap scene and some of the music scenes. But for 
me, luxury is about combination of those who have made some wealth and want to enjoy it. 
There's never a real reason to buy a Porsche or a Ferrari, but people do it. They really enjoy 
it. There's something about the badge. There's something about being inside one of those 
vehicles that makes the driver feel good.

I think there's an aspirational element. So this is where they will talk about having customers 
over multiple years. It's okay for people. I self-deprecated myself earlier about the ties. It's 
okay to start with a scarf, with a tie, and move up through the brand over the years. I think 
ultimately, it's about being part of a club. And let's not forget, these are extremely nice 
items.

They are beautifully made, the Hermès ones are all hand-finished, a real appreciation of the 
finery of the artisanship in terms of they only use the best leather. There's a whole host of 
inputs that go in to make them the nice items. The thing that we struggled with over the 
years to challenge yourself is there's absolutely no economic reason for anyone to buy a 
luxury good. These are all nice to have items. They're not necessities. They're not in the 
hierarchy of needs.

Patrick
Yes, but self-actualization.

Mark
Yes. But what's been interesting is it seems to be a global phenomenon. This is, as I said 
earlier, the geographic spread, and it's the same brands that are doing it. So to me that 
suggests -- you can start to get into the philosophical stuff, but there's some sort of sense 
of belonging thereof I want to be part of this.

Now, some of the challenge I get from younger colleagues would be, I'm in my 50s, but I'm 
actually quite slender, but they say, you're fat and your old and you've got a -- you don't get 
it, our tastes and brands are changing, and we'll probably get into some of the ESG 
considerations. But I disagree with them. I think there's a lot of evidence that actually young 
people are really interested in these brands as well, which is interesting, I think.

And there's been some more than others are collaborating in interesting ways and doing

stuff around the fringes, Hermès a bit less so actually, which tells you something about their 
core customer is definitely older, but they're very patient and waiting for people to sort of 
arrive at Hermès. There's not a definitive answer, I think. And luxury will mean different 
things to different people. I think it's that combination of wanting nice things but beyond 
that wanting to be part of something bigger than oneself.

Patrick
I think it's so interesting that in this case the highest-end brand doesn't have too much of a logo 
on it that you have to know to know, as you said, which I think brings us to like the artisanship 
itself, which you referred to a few times.

I remember one of my favorite things about the episode we did on Rolex was learning about the 
maniacal insane degrees that Rolex would go to, to make the product better, all the way down 
to owning metal foundries themselves because they just weren't pleased with the foundries 
that they were working with as suppliers.

So tell us the story of this part of the business, the artisan, what the constraints are? What the 
business looks like in terms of how vertically integrated it is to the extent that it is? Everything 
you could shed light on about how these things actually get made. It is a manufacturing 
business after all. Talk us through this because, obviously, that's the key thing that fuels the 
product itself that people are buying.

Mark
It's a really interesting model that they don't offshore at all. So it's all made in French ateliers 
and the two constraints are how quickly they could recruit. They are looking for very skilled 
artisans. They estimate that from opening a new studio or production facility, it's about 2 
years of training to get someone up and running. They're relatively small.

So they've looked out to 2024, and they will add -- this is from last year from a 
conversation, they will add 4 or 5 over those 3 years. That equates to allowing them to grow 
volumes at around 10%. It's really different. It's a real choice most of the other companies 
outsource at least parts of it. And they're actually quite quiet about it because they don't 
want you to know, obviously, that the expensive handbag is being made somewhere off a 
beach in Vietnam, yet you're paying a couple of grand for it.

They will say, oh, but it's put together in Italy, and Bottega Veneta, which is another Kerring 
brand, that's all made in Italy, but it's an extremely important part of the Hermès story that 
it's that quality that the other side of the supply side is obviously sourcing the leather itself. 
That's something as an investor, it's harder to get a handle of. We obviously speak to a lot of 
the companies. But one thing we did several years ago, we have a couple of like 
investigative researchers, we call them, who we just sent off to look at companies from 
different angles.

And we had one of the women. We just asked her to go and explore the leather market. She 
thought it was the best breach she'd ever had. She was like, “Really, you're going to pay me 
to get to go to handbag conferences”. And what she came back with was really interesting 
that she said in the leather sourcing -- so she went to some tanning and leather conference 
somewhere in the middle of Italy and came back independently to us and said, “Yes, the 
Hermès guys, they will just pay top dollar for the best leather. There's no questions asked”.

So it has to be a really contiguous part with no staining with new blemishes on it and of a 
size because the bag is made from one contiguous piece of leather. It’s not stitched

together from different panels, which if you start to think about some different handbags, 
you will think, "Oh, yes, there's the under size, and then there's 2 sides". That's one of the 
signatures of the Hermès process.

I thought that was quite interesting corroboration. Like many of them, they are thinking 
about the supply chain of leather, the conditions. They've had a couple of incidents over the 
years. There was a video went viral from an Australian crocodile farm this year. They're 
cognizant of that. They're also looking at some different materials beyond leather.

They won't lead the market in that, but they are starting. So there's a big science around 
mushroom leather and sort of different materials, some of which mimics it, but I think they 
will give consumer choices. Obviously, some people think leather goods just shouldn't be 
manufactured from an animal welfare point of view, some from an environmental point of 
view.

Others would say, actually, if you're slaughtering the cows anyway to produce beef, this is 
just a byproduct, and it should be used. And so actually, they get into a quite complicated 
debate on that. But yes, they're very specific about French production, French artisanship, 
definitely quite snobby.

The French guys are the best in making these bags, but they would say, well, look over the 
years, look at all the competition, they haven't come close to our quality, and these are the 
best bags. So we will invest heavily in training these people. And then I think another feature 
that is interesting is people stay there for decades. So the turnover of staff is extremely low. 
Once you are a Hermès’ artisan, there's really nowhere else to go in the industry.

Patrick
Anything else in its history, I'm especially thinking about how consistent the brand has been, 
even something like as you pointed out at the beginning, the bags literally haven't changed. 
Anything else in its history that you think is especially important that we haven't covered, 
especially as it relates to like existential threats.

Again, thinking about Rolex when it moved from mechanical for it to be possible to have a 
Quartz, more digital watch, like it was an existential moment because all of a sudden, it wasn't 
the most accurate timepiece. They couldn't hang their hat on that anymore. Anything else like 
that, that you think is important to understand the history that Hermès has lived up until this 
point?

Mark
I think it's almost what they have chosen not to do if that makes sense. They could have on 
several occasions really come down the price structure and that EUR 9 billion, there's no 
doubt it could be substantially higher than I would argue it would be lower quality. So it's -- 
they've taken these decisions not to sort of localize the bags. And they've taken the view, I 
think that there will always be enough demand at the high end of the market that they don't 
need to dip down.

I think they would say almost that they're dirtying their hands in the mass market, whereas a 
lot of other brands do get quite stuck there, and you can get quite congested, and you get 
EUR 50 or EUR 100 on price points here, and it's really hard then to resist the call to cut 
prices somewhat to stimulate demand. Probably, the biggest existential threat they face, I 
referenced the end of saddlery. If suddenly everything is virtual. You get virtual lipstick and 
virtual mobiles and we're all good.

I don't know if people might still carry the handbag just to look good, the silk, there was a 
big sort of backlash stroke pricing at the end of the interwar period, and so silk has actually 
came off quite substantially at that stage. So they have, at times, faced some quite large 
external threats. There's been a couple of times in the last couple of decades where the 
ready-to-wear business, I see it as a little bit of a table stakes.

And you have to have it because you have to have these fashion shows in Paris and New 
York. It's not that it's a bad business. It's a decent business, but it's a little bit distracting, I 
think, and it's almost to say, okay, yes, we're a proper fashion house. The interesting thing 
with Hermès is actually the designer, whereas in a lot of places, the designer is so key.

At Hermès, they're much less high profile, and it's a lady that's been there since 2014. It's 
not a TOM FORD. It's not -- I referenced Michele earlier, and he's just left after Gucci after 7 
years. He wants to go out and create somewhere else. And that to me attests to the fact 
that actually there's not much change in the design underlying here.

So it's not something you play around with to meet that's a real attraction that there's -- I 
know next year pretty much what Hermès will be selling, whereas other luxury companies 
they might be a bit more experimental, which has its place. But one of the nice things is that 
it doesn't face those…

Patrick
Design risk. There's no design risk.

Mark
Design risk, yes, and those existential moments, as you said. So that separates out as well, I 
think.

Family Stewardship
Patrick
It's interesting that some of the other things have even technology risk with watches or 
something that there's no technology risk, there's no design risk. The things are just very slow 
rates of change. And that brings us to the family. I'm so interested that it's the sixth generation. 
You mentioned there's like 25 different sections of the family that are shareholders.

And obviously, I think like most people would think in business that a meritocracy that didn't 
have anything to do with what family you were born into would be a superior way to choose 
successive leaders of a business. And yet, there's so many examples of family-controlled 
businesses that last much longer than ones that aren't or surely DNA randomization and 
recombination makes it so that the sixth generation effectively has no relationship to like the 
original family member.

So talk me through everything you've learned about this, like teach us about family stewardship 
and why Hermès has been such a, I guess, maybe the best example in business of stewardship 
across generations, even though there's -- it's spread out so much now.

Mark
I've gleaned quite a lot over the years that you don't meet the family at all. They're very 
much in the back, right, other than those in the executive roles, but I think in many ways, 
that tells you something about it. I remember the first time I met them. So when I was first

interested in this area, I was looking at, obviously, lots of different companies in the area.

And of course, LV has Mr. Arnault and just a very different vibe to how he runs the business 
and been very successful, don't get me wrong, that real acquisitive, quite publicity-seeking 
sort of behavior. So one of the things I think about the Hermès family is it just exists in the 
background as this extremely supportive and allows the company to take these long-term 
decisions.

So you get the sense there's no pressure in the board room to grow faster, let's grow in a 
sustainable, profitable, long-term way. As I said earlier, one of the things I remember being 
told by the first CEO I met was the family are looking 40 years down the road.

The people who are in their 60s and 70s, this is the asset they want to pass to their 
grandchildren. And I've been in 25 years of investment. I can't think of any other company 
that has described itself as that. Every company will tell you, yes, we're really long term and 
here's our forecast for next quarter in the next breath. These guys literally think in decades.

And to me, I think getting through the first couple of iterations because the other question, 
of course, at the back of your mind is, why don't these guys sell out? It's insane to have all 
their wealth tied up in this one asset. It's actually not insane because it's provided such 
good returns.

There's been little eruptions or a couple of family members over the years who do want to 
liquidate, but it's always sort of locked up by other family members have now got 
succession in my mind, obviously, one of my Scottish heroes Brian Cox as the antithesis of 
the family business that Hermès is, any dirty linen is kept away from public view.

So there's a real united front a few years ago, LV, Mr. Arnault was interested in trying to buy 
it. He was trying to flush out weaker family members and LV took quite aggressive, very 
public stake and he just batted it off. He just didn't get anywhere. I think he got to a high 
single-digit proportion of the free floats. There was like a sort of gallop, shrug of the 
shoulder. And is that the best you've got. There's no way you're going to get us here.

Patrick
World's richest man, can't make a dent?

Mark
Yes. He's not used to losing out any muscles. He has had an extremely strong sort of M&A 
record over the years.

Patrick
How do you think they've done this? Obviously, we don't know the answer. So I'm asking you to 
speculate a little bit because they're obviously very private. But is there anything you gleaned 
that gives hints as to practices that are in the family or methods of communication or incentive 
structure, they’re just incredibly resilient. That last example is perfect. How has this happened?

Mark
I think from what I've gleaned is there's no dominant shareholdings unlike Cucinelli, you 
talked about earlier or obviously, there's now a big debate around which of Mr. Arnault's 
offspring takeover and there's a clear front-runner note. From what I know and what you 
can see some of the disclosed takes, that's pretty flat. So I guess that's an advantage of 

Business Breakdowns - Hermès: The Luxury Icon

having so many family members. Back of the day in the 1800s and early 1900s, there would 
have been more dominant stakes, but they've managed to get that.

So even if you get an agitator and some of you might say, come on, guys, let's monetize, it's 
a big market cap now, there could be people that could transfer paper wealth into very 
strong actual wealth. I don't know if there are structures behind the scenes, which are 
almost disincentives to that in terms of financial loss, that might be something that is in 
there. We're not privy to that part of the share register. I guess it's just the case of this has 
worked for so long.

I think there's a massive sense of pride of who wouldn't be proud of a business that is 185 
years old, which has arguably the world's best brands as its primary asset. These will all be 
fabulously wealthy individuals. So there's no liquidity necessity. I do think the more 
generations you go through, the more solid it becomes if that makes sense. You've also got 
that collective memory of this is okay.

Patrick
Don't want to be the one that breaks the chain.

Mark
Don't want to be the one that breaks the chain, but also this works, this transfer of wealth. 
And remember that in France, there are high taxes on monetization of family businesses.

Patrick
Meaning if they were to sell. So they're making their money through dividends.

Mark
Exactly, dividends and share price appreciation. It is fascinating. It probably, again, defies 
some of the business school logic and I love companies that defy business school logic. The 
other thing that always intrigues me, of course, and this is something I say to our younger 
investors is you can look at the balance sheet of Hermès. It's a rock-solid balance sheet. 
There's lots of cash there, but it doesn't tell you anything about the business because 
they've never transacted, there's no goodwill.

There's no intangible asset, and yet the whole business is this massive intangible asset of 
how much would you have to spend and how many years, as you said earlier, would you 
spend to recreate this. That's not unique to Hermès. You could say the same about Apple or 
hundreds of businesses which have been organically grown from that first idea, but it is 
something that people who look purely at the financials of the business sometimes 
underappreciate.

Patrick
We haven't talked in much detail about the endpoints. You mentioned that it would be a 
champagne and caviar affair sitting down for an hour to buy one of these things. But talk a little 
bit more about literally where you can buy Hermès goods.

And anything interesting about their strategy of endpoint distribution or partnership with 
distributors, I would just really love to understand their thinking because with all this heritage, 
with all this constraint around how one can be produced, how many can be produced and so on, 
I'm sure that they care just as much about which stores get them, how they get them, how it's

bought. What lessons can we learn here that might be interesting?

Mark
It's almost 100% through their own stores. So they will have some concessions in 
department stores in cities where they don't want to invest the capital. But as I understand 
it, it's really hard. So the process of acquiring one of these, you become a customer of 
Hermès and you might buy one of those entry-level items, you might buy pair of shoes or a 
lower-entry handbag and then you go into a waiting list. I think on average, it's probably 
about a year, 1.5 years. And you kind of apply to become an owner of the handbag.

It's not just hey, I've got the dosh, I'm good to go. It's not that simple. And effectively, 
they're screening you as a customer, and then they obviously have the flagship stores. 
They're not huge stores because they don't have a massive sq new line. I think the average 
size, one of my analysts did an update last year, it's about 525 square meters.

So we reckon roughly their sales per square meter will be about EUR 50,000, which is I 
actually can't imagine off the chart, even Apple in its prime the Fifth Avenue store, it was 
nowhere near that. They've got stores in all the cities you would expect, but not absolutely 
huge numbers. They've got mid-teens numbers in China, where some of the companies will 
have 200. So you've got to any mall in China, they're there and Hermès will be present in the 
major ones.

So they're quite deliberate about where they place and then as ever, there is a sort of 
original store, so that's in Rue du Faubourg in Paris. That's the kind of ultimate pilgrimage. It 
is a bigger store, more of the flagship variety. And I've been in there once that was on a 
certain investment trip. And I was sort of looked on with quite a look of the disdain as if…

Patrick
Something does not belong.

Mark
I sort of had a quick look around. And I felt not intimidated.

Patrick
Out of place?

Mark
Yes, out of place. It's good to know your limits, and I'm happy to invest, but I'm not going to 
be one of their key customers in that store.

Luxury Strategy
Patrick
I was just pulling up one of my favorite books. This is a book called The Luxury Strategy. This 
book is so interesting and so often the business strategy behind luxury companies is literally the 
opposite. And there's one chapter in there that's called the anti-laws of marketing. I'll read some 
off here. Do not pander to your customers' wishes, keep non-enthusiasts out, do not respond to 
rising demand, dominate the client, I like that one, make it difficult for clients to buy. I mean 
you've mentioned all of these things.

But one of them is really interesting, it literally says, do not sell. This is a pull, not push thing. So 
I'd love you to talk about marketing because, well, maybe they don't want to sell directly and 
they actually make it hard to buy, which you've described, you still need people to know about 
the brand.

One of the ideas from this book that I remember, though I don't have it in front of me, was 
something like you want the ratio of people that know about a brand to those that can buy it to 
be as big as possible, and that's really marketing. So how has Hermès done marketing 
historically? What is it strategy? What have you learned from it?

Mark
I'd describe them as pretty discrete. So they're in historically, they will be the folks at the 
high-end fashion press. They do the fashion shows, as I said, but they never make the 
biggest flash. The interesting thing is we started off talking about the Kelly and the Birkin.

But you'll never see massive New York or London underground adverts with huge bags on 
the wall saying buy me. They advertise in quite a subliminal way, it's almost quite a playful 
way in recent years. They've used quite a lot of animation, we're just a kind of interesting 
brand, find out a bit more.

But I do think they're in that class of companies, to your point, people just know about 
them. It's hard to pin down exactly why that is. They'll have their usual high-end polo 
matches or I skied a couple of times in Switzerland and St. Moritz is pretty swanky for me. 
You see lots of people walking around in the literally ankle-length fur coats carrying a couple 
of Hermès bags.

They have a thing called White Turf there, which is horseracing on ice, which is actually 
quite cool. It's kind of interesting, and that's the sort of thing they'll sponsor because it's just 
high end. It's not blingy. It's not aggressive in your face kind of advertising, it's a very 
average percentage of sales that they expended it.

The only brand I can think of that is similar, a completely different industry is Tesla. Tesla has 
never spent a dime on advertising, which is kind of insane when you actually think about it, 
billions of people know about Tesla now and good or bad, different opinions. And I don't 
think Hermès has that ubiquity, but it has enough presence in enough consumers that it 
comes back to that. This is the ultimate -- if you're going to own one bag and lots of people 
have more than one bag, obviously.

But if you forced most consumers to choose, they would choose a Hermès. And that, to me, 
gets to the real essence of why it's special because every one of their competitors would 
want to be in that position and they'll advertise the hell out of it. But they can't replicate it 
for all the reasons we've discussed.

There is this uniqueness of this unique positioning, which must drive the competitor isn't 
seen actually. I think I actually followed two camps. We have some management meetings 
where they just fix that, but Hermès is all this different level. They're sort of competing...

Patrick
Just move on.

Mark
Yes. They're the kind of Champions League soccer reference. They're playing up at this level. 
We're down in the Premier League. We're going to compete for that price. Others still do try

to get up there but can't do it.

Patrick
How would you attack the brand? Let's say I said to you, you can have any talent you want in 
the world, you can have $10 billion, like I want you to burn $10 billion, any designer, any product 
category. If you wanted to assault Hermès heads on, I guess it wouldn't be heads-on, maybe to 
win, but what would you do?

Mark
We sit around our investment table and think, right, if I had the capital here, how would I 
compete. You would get some current timeless celebrity. So I don't know if somewhere 
British biases that an Emma Watson or someone really cool. So to me, it's that sort of 
naming of the brand. And we then try and steal their artisans, that would have worked, I 
know for a fact because they'd be like Mark who is this Scottish guy, he's never designed a 
handbag and I could try and cherry pick the best people across the industry, but I just don't 
think it would work.

You could throw so much money as you say, if money was no object and you could market 
the hell out of it, I'd probably try and go even higher in price than them. I think then people 
would say, well, that's ridiculous. I'll just buy a Birkin. So I probably flipflop, I'd get 
discombobulated by how hard they were to compete with. And I would end up giving up, I 
think. I've never come across a company where I can't imagine the core competence being 
competed, I guess.

I think as an investor, you always have to ask yourself that question, well, what, like many 
others, we've been debating companies like Facebook, Meta, Alibaba, companies that seem 
to have these amazing moats and you mentioned earlier, but actually, they've been 
competed away or at least the growth rates are substantially lower now and that's for a 
variety of reasons.

But in Hermès, the thing that I think that could derail Hermès is just the overall market hits a 
wall. We saturate luxury or there's a massive change in societal attitudes that is a plausible 
threat. I think it's quite low likelihood, but it's obviously extremely high impact. I don't see it 
being derailed competitively. And that to me feels almost unique.

Patrick
What comes closest and not other luxury brands. So outside of luxury, what companies that 
you've ever investigated, however big or small, have a sustainable competitive position that has 
shades of Hermès just to like orient people in company space. Is there anything else that comes 
to mind?

Mark
The one that immediately pops into mind is Ferrari.

Patrick
So that's luxury.

Mark
It is luxury I know. I was kind of trying for a free pass there…

Patrick
Let's try, it's also a horse company.

Mark
Just invest in horses, man, that's the lesson. Maybe some -- I've got a couple of medical 
device companies. We've been long-term investors in Intuitive Surgical. And there's been 
tons of people who have tried to compete over the years, but the whole ecosystem they 
have and the years and years of operating, and I think they started in Vietnam and the kind 
of military hospitals and using robots to some know-how and some that's about a 50-year 
competitive advantage periods. Maybe some sports franchises, jumping.

So I'm big into my soccer as I said earlier, Man United fan and you look at what people are 
saying, Man United might go for this for sale, the Glazers have been much more commercial 
owners taking a lot of money out, but that brand, we sucked for 10 years. We've not come 
near the title since Alex Ferguson retired, but that brand is indestructible still globally it's 
kind of up there.

And that is that uniqueness and its heritage. It's got 20 English titles. It's got The Busby 
Babes. You've got David Beckham, George Best, Cantona, there are several people that exist 
who aren’t Man United fan will say, he’s talking a lot of c***. Liverpool is strong and -- but 
there's probably about 20 global sporting franchises that might come close, and I think they 
do share some of the attributes, but it's fascinatingly unique.

Patrick
There's this line, I think about all the time attributed to Bill Gates back in the '90s, which is that 
supply is the killer of value. As you've discussed that Hermès, I just keep thinking about that line. 
You can't introduce new supply of this heritage and the story. You can't introduce new supply of 
so many aspects of it. They've themselves metered out supply to be 7% or 8% growth per year. 
When you really back up from all this, you mentioned the high-level economics of the business.

But if you look at just the shareholder returns over the last 30 years, it's absolutely crushed 
global indexes. I mean I think it's something like 7x to 10x for the S&P and like 40x for Hermès. 
That brings us to today, though. So it would have been great to earn that return historically. It 
trades at a very high price earnings multiple. How do you think about valuation in a business like 
this? I mean, obviously, like markets are smart. The business is obviously exceptionally high 
quality, cash flow machine.

But how do you think about price because return can either come from fundamental growth? 
You said maybe it will double in the next decade or from multiple change and the multiple is 
high. So it could get higher. But how do you think about those 2 sources of return for a business 
like this looking forward?

Mark
That's literally the billion-dollar question. So the first starting point would be for 20 years, 
we've debated the valuation. I'd be the kind of curmudgeonly guy in the corner saying, you 
can't put a price on something that can grow forever. But let's do the DCS, work out on your 
spreadsheet, there is 2 elements to me.

So the first one is coming back to that intangible brand, what is this brand worth and in 
terms of trying to put a valuation on that, I think the value of a long-term growth 
opportunity is consistently undervalued in the sense that you're quite right, say, near-term 
PE on this is high, the price to cash flow, the price of sales, they're high. There's no -- I think 

Business Breakdowns - Hermès: The Luxury Icon

C
l ssus, LLC.



currently, we're sort of 50x forecast. When we first bought it, that was about 35x.

So just for some context, there has been a relatively modest PE rating. So most of that has 
come through compound growth. I do think that this is as a survey my portfolio and you put 
confidence intervals on which company will be around in 2050 to really push the envelope 
out. This would be #1.

This would be the top of my list that this company will be here. The secondary question 
would be, okay, well, that's okay, but what size is going to be and can plausibly grow another 
10%, hang on, you're starting to get into the 100 billions of euros quite quickly. Is that 
plausible? That's one of the debates we're having.

The second one, this is probably more short-term tactical, but what sort of business do I 
want to own as a long-term investor at the moment the premium that I'll pay for certainty or 
near certainty of all my businesses, this feels one of the most predictable. I think you're 
absolutely right. I think the market is more appreciating that. So this is not the largest 
holding in my portfolio, but it's a reasonably sized holding, and it feels a really solid base.

While I try to compute all of the stuff that's going on, what's happening with growth 
elsewhere and there is so much changing elsewhere that this is almost the beacon of, okay, 
I'm not going to say I'm going to park money here, but it feels to me as if the fundamentals 
aren't changing. We haven't addressed the fact that this is actually one of the best inflation 
hedges. The pricing power that these guys have historically, they've got up mid-single 
digits. Last year, they'd be prices up double digits.

So yes, some improved price that they just passed, no one cares. They just pass it on. 
There's a live debate for us internally on, I would say, size of holding, and I will fight tooth 
and nail to still own some of this with my sort of younger, trendier colleagues. I do just think 
there's something special about a business that I can pretty much say today to my clients, 
this company will be around doing the same thing in 10, 20, 30 years' time. There's not many 
of those. But it's really easy to say, well, that's all priced in.

But if you're just patient and if it can grow, what if margins get to 45% or 50%, what if 
actually we've not seen anything yet from the Middle East or we've not explored Tier 3 to 6 
China or actually Denver and Kansas City are huge growth markets. There could be lots of 
other legs of growth here. There's always been a debate about valuation. To me, it's worth it.

Patrick
There's a famous story about Tim Cook flying to see Warren Buffett or someone at Berkshire 
before Berkshire started really aggressively buying Apple. When he basically said, look, we're 
going to return excess capital through buybacks and dividends to shareholders, not fund some 
big moonshot bank or not stray from what made us, us. And obviously, that's been an incredible 
investment story for Buffett.

Maybe just say a closing word on capital allocation of this business, which sounds very simple. 
Like you said, they've never really done anything. So haven't been big acquisitions, haven't been 
big sales. It's not goodwill. There are un-intangibles, but good capital allocation is always 
important in long-term stories. Maybe just say a word on how they've chosen to allocate excess 
capital and what they've done with it.

Mark
I think on capital allocation, very conservative. There's an argument that there's too much 
cash on the balance sheet. So the dividend is consistent. It's by no means a great shape. I

think the current yield is about 0.5%. They could be substantially higher. What they have 
done has been very disciplined over the years on not investing in the business and not 
straying too far away.

They had a dalliance of trying to fund a new brand in China, which probably dates back 
about 15 years ago. That hasn't really worked, which is interesting. They actually sold down 
last year to become a minority shareholder in that. It was called Shang Xia and it was 
backing a young Chinese designer, very beautiful, comes back to that conversation we were 
having about oriental art designship, really nice, beautiful items.

But even within the Chinese market, there's a niche, it's never really grown, and I think 
they've decided that's not the case. So they're very different from the rest of the industry. 
So some people say sort of really inefficient balance sheet. I think it just reflects they are 
very safe, very good guardians, they've made a couple of specials over the years, but 
nothing flash.

Well, the handbags I would say quite flash, but there's nothing flash about the way they run 
the business. I am sure that part of their DNA is they think we're stewarding this business. 
We are owners, that we're stewards for future generations and that transfer of family wealth 
is so intrinsic to the DNA.

Patrick
It's so interesting to me that in an era that's mostly been dominated by technology companies 
or companies where the product experiences a high rate of change that there's a business like 
this and others that is in so many ways, incredibly simple and unchanging and yet is a $170 
billion company or whatever it is today.

If you think about this business now holistically, I'd love to close with one of our favorite 
questions to ask people, which is in all the time you spend with this business. If you were to pull 
out one lesson for operators and one lesson for investors that this business has most taught 
you, what would those 2 lessons be in closing?

Mark
I would say that operators, we spend a lot of time trying to answer the question, what's the 
culture of this business. And I want people that are aligned to my long-term time frame, and 
it's got harder and harder over the years because every company kind of…

Patrick
Plays that game.

Mark
Yes, they play that game and they got highly polished IR guys going blah, blah, blah, and 
literally, I no longer read the quarterly transcript. I'll let my younger colleagues read them, I 
just find they suck the energy out to me because it's so short term. And as I referenced 
earlier, Hermès, they're very different. They're almost like works of art themselves, the 
quarterly, they have to release them under French stock exchange.

It is that DNA of the actions speaking larger than the words of show me that you're long-
term by taking these, by choosing all the choices you take, all of those little things that add 
up to that the extraordinary brands and that competitive advantage, that's really, really 
important.

So when we first invested in a new company, our style is quite concentrated, quite large 
holdings, we'll pop up on the shareholder list and IR, well, we probably talked to it before 
we've invested, obviously, and they'll reach out, hey, you guys do you want a quarterly call. 
We're like, no, we're good. We'd love to talk about the next 10 years and like, okay. Next 
quarter say, hey, you guys you want a quarterly call, so it takes about 18 months and then 
we realized actually they really do once a quarterly call. That's just our style.

But with Hermès, that was never the case. It was always -- yes, we'd love to talk about 2030 
and 2035, is that intangible actions? And then for investors, I think it's that previous 
conversation we were having. It's about how do you value longevity. If you are a growth 
investor, one of the things I think I've learned more in the last 2, 3 years of investing that I 
hadn’t in the previous 20 in terms of what's happened, the pandemic valuations and 
exogenous shocks.

The value of longevity and near-certainty, I'm not going to say certainty because nothing is 
certain. That's definitely what the world has taught us, but there is a huge value in me being 
able to say to you or to my clients, this business is going to be around in X years, and my 
confidence interval that they can grow in this rate. There's been this extraordinary period, as 
you alluded to, of these technology businesses, just absolutely exploding, going to huge 
verticals.

But as I look back on that now, almost growing a little bit too fast and kind of sucking so 
much growth that it has made it harder now at the scale and everyone's looking for the 
second act in a lot of these businesses and Amazon did it with AWS. Meta hasn't really done 
it. But the beauty of this business is it doesn't need a second act. The first act is 185 years 
old. And it's still the same act that's still doing well.

I think as investors, because we're all drawn so much, you try to train yourself to get off the 
hamster wheel, but it's so hard in our worlds not to be influenced by the next 6 months, the 
next 12 months, that beauty of really trying to push out your time frame to 10 and 20 years 
and think what business will be engrained and flourishing there, which isn’t really hard.

Your podcasts are always really dealing with that question, I guess, of what makes those 
businesses -- these great franchises and these great businesses, but it's almost getting out 
of your comfort zone of, okay, I can predict this in the next 12, 18 months, is sort of saying, 
here's a business, look at the growth rate. If I have a high confidence level that this can last, 
that's extremely valuable. My colleagues who will listen to this will say here he goes again. I 
heard this one before, but I do think it's really important.

Patrick
Well, Mark, this has been just an awesome exploration of a really simple but fascinating business 
for all the reasons that you've laid out. Thank you so much for your time.

Mark
Yes, it's been a real pleasure. I really enjoyed it, maybe one day we will meet in a Hermès 
store, and both will look sort of quite silly together.

Patrick
It's a date.

Mark

# Transcript 3

[00:00:00] Clay Finck: Over the past 20 years, some of the best performing companies in the stock market have come from the luxury sector. For example, Hermes and LVMH, which are both companies based out of France, have compounded at 21 percent and 16 percent respectively. The thing about these luxury brands, though, is that you need to take almost everything you learned about business and economics and essentially throw it out the window.

[00:00:22] Clay Finck: For instance, when the best luxury companies increase their prices, they oftentimes see higher demand for their products and not lower. And the Hermes CEO is on record for saying when a product sells too well, they’ll pull it off the shelves. To help break down the DNA of luxury companies, I’m joined by Christian Billinger to talk about the lessons from the book, The Luxury Strategy by Kapferer and Bastien.

[00:00:47] Clay Finck: Christian is the chairman of Billinger Förvaltnings AB, which is a privately held company based out of Sweden that invests in publicly listed equities. His firm seeks to generate attractive long term total returns without employing financial leverage. During this chat, Christian and I cover how luxury companies create their own demand.

[00:01:05] Clay Finck: The primary differences between a premium and a luxury product. What the non return effect is and how it can make luxury companies more resilient. An overview of Kapferer’s anti laws of marketing, which is definitely my favorite part of the book. How luxury brands approach e- commerce and pricing and much more.

[00:01:23] Clay Finck: I really enjoyed reading through this book and Christian is the perfect guest to bring on the show to discuss these topics as he’s been invested in the luxury sector for many years. This is a fascinating discussion, unveiling the luxury sector. So with that, I hope you enjoyed today’s episode with Christian Billinger.

[00:01:41] Intro: Celebrating 10 years and more than 150 million downloads. You are listening to The Investor’s Podcast Network. Since 2014, we studied the financial markets and read the books that influence self-made billionaires the most. We keep you informed and prepared for the unexpected. Now for your host, Clay Finck.

[00:02:09] Clay Finck: Hey everyone. Welcome to The Investor’s Podcast. I’m your host, Clay Fink. And today we bring back Christian Billinger. Christian, it’s great to have you back on the show.

[00:02:18] Christian Billinger: Pleasure to be back. Thank you for inviting me again, Clay. Good to see you.

[00:02:22] Clay Finck: So over the past few months, Christian, as you know, I’ve taken an interest in the luxury sector, which for someone like me that grew up in the Midwest, It’s something that’s very new to me and something I don’t have a lot of real life exposure to yet I’ve heard all about it when it comes to the stock market because some of the best performing companies have been coming from the luxury sector to name a few that includes LVMH, Ferrari, and Hermes These companies, they seem to break all the standard rules of capitalism and how to succeed in business, which in my opinion, makes them very interesting companies to study.

[00:02:57] Clay Finck: So for the audience, Christian pointed me to this book called The Luxury Strategy by Kapferer and Bastien. To help me better understand the industry. And I’ve invited Christian onto the show to share with the audience what he’s learned from this sector. So to help set the stage for this conversation, Christian, how about you start by just talking about your experience with the luxury industry?

[00:03:18] Christian Billinger: Yeah, sure. Delighted to, and excited to have this conversation about the sector and the book specifically. So I’ve been investing European equities for 20 years now. So my experience is as an investor, not as an operator, but I’ve looked at the large European conglomerates, which tend to be French. So LVMH, Hermes, and we’ve been invested in those two for a number of years.

[00:03:39] Christian Billinger: We’ve also been invested in Remy Cointreau for a few years, which although formally speaking is a spirits business. Much of their revenues and even more of their earnings generate from or derived from sales of what you would consider a true luxury product. So I’ve looked at the space for a number of years, and I think being based in Europe and being sort of predominantly focused on European equities.
[00:04:01] Christian Billinger: As you alluded to, that’s been one of the best sort of corners of the European market to be generating returns in for the last decade plus. So that’s my experience as an investor.

[00:04:12] Clay Finck: So I’m big on just getting everyone on the same page. So luxury, I think is going to mean a different thing to almost everybody.

[00:04:21] Clay Finck: How would you define it if someone were to ask you to do so?

[00:04:25] Christian Billinger: So there are so many ways of defining it and it depends on which point of view you take. Are you trying to define this as a consumer or as an operator? But I think for the purposes of this conversation, I think the most meaningful way to define it is as an investor.

[00:04:39] Christian Billinger: And I think in some ways you could argue, what does it matter whether you call it a luxury business or a premium business or a fast moving consumer goods business. But I think it does matter because it has a real impact on how durable, you know, the competitive advantage of the business is and what the metrics look like and how you should think about sustainably high returns on capital, et cetera.

[00:04:59] Christian Billinger: So I think it does matter whether a business actually operates as a true luxury business or not. So there’s a few things that I would look at to get a sense of whether we’re looking at a true luxury business. Possibly the most crucial one is are we looking at what I would call a singular product or experience?

[00:05:15] Christian Billinger: And I think we’ll get back to the comparison between luxury and premium, et cetera. But the idea of a singular product or experience is that these are tend to be products or services that cannot easily or cannot be compared to any other product or service, right? So they have a real identity as opposed to a positioning in the market.

[00:05:34] Christian Billinger: And therefore it’s often more difficult to define the competitive set. And the true competitive set would often be much broader than for most other consumer goods businesses you look at. So, singularity is one word I would keep in mind. And then I think in terms of how these businesses are run, one of the sort of main lessons I’ve taken from looking at these companies is that they tend to do the right thing most of the time, at least, so they seem to have a very long time frame.

[00:06:01] Christian Billinger: They, you know, they invest up front. Now, these are generalizations, but generally speaking, they care about product quality, even in situations or even when looking at aspects of a product or service that the customer may not be willing to pay a premium for. So there’s a real sense of companies doing the right thing over time.

[00:06:18] Christian Billinger: So if you look at our mess is a good example of that Chanel is a good example of that, keeping in mind that some of the companies that are formally classified as luxury companies, I wouldn’t consider to be luxury companies. So clearly that applies to some of the American, you know, if you look at a Coach or Michael Kors, I think are good examples of that.

[00:06:36] Christian Billinger: But even if you look at some of the European names like a Burberry, and I know Kapferer sort of refers to Burberry a number of times in his book, and he says it’s not really or truly a luxury business if you look at the way they operate. So I think that’s also so important to keep in mind. So they’re probably 2 of the key things that I would look at to determine.

[00:06:53] Christian Billinger: Are we looking at a true luxury business, and then you can go into all kinds of detail. But I think they would be the two ones I’d look at. In terms of the experience from the customer point of view, I think it’s also important to remember that there needs to be a social element to the product or service for it to be a luxury in a commercial sense and in a sort of financial, you know, investor sense.

[00:07:14] Christian Billinger: And so the idea there is if you look at many artisans or makers of high quality bespoke goods. They may very well be high quality products, but there’s no social dimension, right? So there’s no element of showing off if you will, to use this slightly sort of negative connotation. And so therefore I think in a, for the purposes of our discussion, the artisans and the sort of small independent bespoke makers would not be considered luxury businesses, right?

[00:07:40] Christian Billinger: So they would probably be two or three things I would look at clay to figure out if I’m looking at a true luxury business. And then finally, the fact that these businesses and the market overall tends to be driven more by the offering than the demand side. So in some sense, these companies create, you know, their own market.

[00:07:55] Christian Billinger: They create their own demand by offering things to the consumer that the consumer may not realize they need or desire or even dream of, right? So there’s a number of unique characteristics to these businesses, which I think make them very interesting to study. Sometimes it’s difficult to determine if you’re looking at a true luxury business or not.

[00:08:13] Christian Billinger: And sometimes within these large groups, take an LVMH for instance, some of their offering for some of their brands, take cosmetics or perfumes. Some of that offering, I probably wouldn’t classify as a luxury business, right? But they’re still part of the group and they generate some revenues at group level.

[00:08:28] Christian Billinger: And then you have some parts of the business, say the LV or Dior brands, and especially leather goods and apparel, where it’s much easier to say that this operates as a true luxury business. So, you know, you can attempt to draw these distinctions, but I think sometimes the lines are blurred. Yeah. So those are probably a few things to keep in mind.

[00:08:47] Clay Finck: Yeah, that was wonderful. There’s a lot of strings are going to be pulling throughout this conversation on a lot of the points you made there. My next question is just looking at the luxury market overall, it’s a very large market. Many people might think about clothes or bags or watches or cars that Ferrari sells.

[00:09:06] Clay Finck: What product categories do you think are most prevalent within the luxury space?

[00:09:12] Christian Billinger: So I think when you talk about personal luxury goods, and that’s usually when you look at the listed groups, certainly the French conglomerates and the Italian sort of often still family controlled businesses, they will most often be active in personal luxury goods.

[00:09:26] Christian Billinger: And so these would be things like clearly handbags, apparel, what we call hard luxury, which is jewelry, right? Watches, those kinds of things. But it wouldn’t include things like, you know, depending on which definition you choose, but if you look at cars for instance, they usually wouldn’t be included in the definition of personal luxury, which I think when I look at Bain’s numbers, I think they say for 2023, the total luxury market as they define it, was something like one and a half trillion euros.

[00:09:55] Christian Billinger: And I think about a quarter of that is personal luxury, what they define as personal luxury. So say 400 billion US or so. And then, in addition, you have things like fine art, fine wine, you know, yachts, all these kinds of things, and also on the experience side, right, so luxury holidays and cruises, but they wouldn’t be sort of included in the definition that applies to the sort of European listed conglomerates, which I think is perhaps the most relevant one to think about.

[00:10:22] Christian Billinger: You know, for us as investors in these companies. So that’s probably the broad breakdown of the market.

[00:10:28] Clay Finck: And Kapferer makes it very clear that there’s a very big difference between a premium product and a luxury product. He tells one example of Ford trying to kind of weasel their way into being a luxury brand to which they failed.

[00:10:42] Clay Finck: It’s been viewed as, you know, a classical car company that provides cars to the masses. So it’s just not a market they could really get into. If you were to try and explain the difference between just a very high quality or a premium product and a luxury product, how would you describe what those main differences are?

[00:11:01] Christian Billinger: One interesting sort of categorization that I’ve heard is that luxury tends to be French, fashion tends to be Italian, premium tends to be German, and mass media prestige tends to be American. That’s obviously, I’m sure highly offensive to some people and, you know, it’s a very broad generalization, but I think it gets the idea across, right?

[00:11:21] Christian Billinger: I think most people can probably see that there are some sort of reflection of these different cultural identities in there. So I think what distinguishes luxury from premium is this idea of singularity. By which I mean that the luxury groups. You know, everything they do from their product offering to the way they market these things, to the way they price and distribute them is focused on this idea of singularity, right?

[00:11:46] Christian Billinger: So that these products aren’t easily compared to other products in the same or similar categories. When you look at premium on the other hand, and I think the classic example that Kapferer refers to is cars, right? So if you look at German cars, these would often be thought of as a premium product and the crucial point there is that you can compare them in terms of performance, right?

[00:12:07] Christian Billinger: So whether it’s in terms of speed or whether it’s in terms of boot space or whether in terms of emissions. Or range with electric vehicles or any of these things. And so, therefore, you can compare performance across a number of metrics. And therefore, you can also, as a consumer, you can take a view on whether, you know, on the equation of price versus value.

[00:12:27] Christian Billinger: But that’s much more difficult or often impossible or irrelevant when it comes to luxury goods, because the way they’re marketed, right, is much more about identity than it is about positioning. And so, for instance, you would never see our mass marketing any of their products relative to Chanel or even to make reference to any of their competitors.

[00:12:47] Christian Billinger: You rarely ever see, or I would argue, you probably never see any product claims in the advertising, right? It’s usually very. Sort of minimalist, right? It’s all about the identity and the feelings and emotions that that evokes. So hopefully that makes the idea between premium and luxury clear. Cause I think often there, if you’re not being sort of disciplined with these definitions, I think many people interchange the two or say, you know, higher end premium or, but I think from an investor and operator point of view, they’re very distinctive ways of running a business.

[00:13:19] Clay Finck: Yeah, this is really interesting because I think a key part of luxury you mentioned is sort of social signaling, signaling to others, sort of your values and signaling your wealth to some degree to even in America, you mentioned America, you can just look at brands like Apple and Starbucks, like they certainly aren’t luxury, but you’re still sort of signaling something.

[00:13:40] Clay Finck: So there’s something to it where, you know, like a Hermes handbag that costs over 10, 000 euros to purchase. There’s something to it where there’s a history behind the company and this appreciation for the way they do things, and it’s signaling something very different to your values.

[00:13:57] Christian Billinger: Yes, absolutely. Yeah, I think, I mean, you touched on the heritage point.

[00:14:01] Christian Billinger: I think that’s another important aspect of these businesses. You know, most of them, of course, coming out of Europe, France, Italy, specifically. I think that’s one of the things that will hopefully mean as an investor in these companies that will hopefully mean that they can better withstand the challenge of new entrants.

[00:14:17] Christian Billinger: If you look at the Chinese market or the Indian market, there’s another good book on the sector called Selling Europe to the World, I believe, which sort of talks about this idea that in a way you’re, you know, we’re exporting this sort of cultural identity to other markets and parts of the world. That’s another very important aspect of these businesses.

[00:14:36] Christian Billinger: Most of the brands, if you look at the LVMH portfolio of 75 or 80 brands, most of these go back with some exceptions go back a long, long time. And if anything, I think somewhat unique feature of them is that they often improve over time, right? So they become more durable. There’s an element of Lindy to refer to that idea, right?

[00:14:54] Christian Billinger: So often with these brands and businesses, the longer they’ve been around, the longer their life expectancy.

[00:15:01] Clay Finck: So selling Europe to the world. I’m curious if you know geographical breakdown, obviously a lot of these French companies are going to be prevalent in France and other areas of Europe, and I know China is a very prevalent and growing market.

[00:15:14] Clay Finck: How do you look at or what are you seeing in terms of geographical breakdown and what markets accept this idea of luxury?

[00:15:21] Christian Billinger: Certainly over the last couple of decades, China has been the big, it’s been a very big part of the overall market. So if we refer to Chinese purchases, so that would include purchases, both made in China and elsewhere, predominantly in Europe by Chinese consumers.

[00:15:35] Christian Billinger: I think over the last 20 years, that’s been something like, let’s say the Chinese account for about a third of the personal luxury market. But I think over the last two decades, they’ve accounted for something like two thirds of the growth of that market. So clearly that has been the big driver of that market.

[00:15:50] Christian Billinger: And then you’ve had relatively similar proportions accounted for by European and American consumers. So that’s been the sort of broad splits. And so I think it’s right that people are concerned about any, you know, deceleration in China, but it’s a very large market fragmentation, certainly behind albium age remains, you know, very significant. So I think there are opportunities to growth both organically in terms of consolidation. And then, of course, you see these large groups entering new adjacency. So in the case of LVMH, for instance, they’ve been investing into experiences. So they’ve been acquiring hotel chains and the like.

[00:16:28] Christian Billinger: So I would like to think that there’s significant runway for growth here. And on top of that, You know, we touched on this idea that these companies effectively create the market themselves. And so I think in some ways they’re more in control of their own destiny than some other consumer groups, because, you know, assuming they can provide products and experience that consumers are willing to pay for.

[00:16:51] Christian Billinger: It’s probably wrong to say that there’s limitless growth, but I think there’s much more opportunity. If you get it right, there’s more opportunity to grow for a long period of time than there is in some other more sort of consumer demand driven industries.

[00:17:04] Clay Finck: And I think that’s an important point to get into a little bit more.

[00:17:08] Clay Finck: Hundreds of years ago, luxury was sort of reserved for the kings, the emperors. You know, extremely exclusive. And now the luxury sector is sort of seeing some tailwinds where these very wealthy people, this class has sort of grown and grown over the years. You know, they also expand internationally. They expand a new product segments.

[00:17:27] Clay Finck: So it seems like the luxury sector has a lot of wins at its back in terms of growth as well. I’m curious if you could speak more to that.

[00:17:34] Christian Billinger: Yeah. So in terms of the customer demographics, if you speak to these companies, they will say we don’t sell to the very rich. Generally, well, of course, they do sell to the very rich, but most of their revenues, they would argue are not from the very rich.

[00:17:47] Christian Billinger: It’s from the, as call them the mass affluent. Having said that the numbers I’ve seen from Bain, I think for 22 suggests that about 2 percent of customers by volume account for about 40 percent of personal luxury purchases by value. So clearly there’s a very significant skew there and I think it’s also increased that skew has increased in recent years.

[00:18:07] Christian Billinger: So through the pandemic, the rate of increase in terms of spending for the very wealthy or high spending customers has been much higher than for the low spending customers or lower value customers. So I think there’s been a bit of a polarization there. And you can also see that when you look at who’s, which of these companies have done the best in the last, say, three or five or seven years, generally speaking, the brands that sell to the wealthiest demographics.

[00:18:31] Christian Billinger: Right? So, clearly, Hermes, Chanel, Cucinelli to speak of a sort of smaller player, although listed. So that’s been one of the key trends there. And you can also see that these companies are, you know, spending more time and effort and money on entertaining these very important high spending clients, right?

[00:18:50] Christian Billinger: So there’s a real sort of battle, I think, for their attention. So there’s much more going on in terms of private events and viewings and dinners and travel, etc. So I think that’s one important thing to keep in mind. Another one is that, of course, these demographic characteristics will vary by market. So if you look at the Chinese typical, if there is one luxury consumer, they would tend to skew much younger, right?

[00:19:12] Christian Billinger: And then if you look at, say, Western European or American consumers, they will probably much more often be self made. And so there’s a number of these things to keep in mind. But yeah, they’re probably one or two of the sort of important trends in terms of customer demographics.

[00:19:26] Clay Finck: One of the interesting points that resonated with me in the book was what Kapferer called the non return effect, which very much reminded me of the hedonic treadmill that many people fall into.

[00:19:38] Clay Finck: So the hedonic treadmill explains how, once one makes more money, their expectations and their desires rise with that rise in income, and humans were kind of hardwired to always want more. But, you know, more stuff doesn’t always make us any happier because we eventually become accustomed to that new lifestyle and just want more and more things.

[00:19:57] Clay Finck: So Kapferer had written, once people have tasted luxury in whatever area, it is very difficult for them to turn away from it. Have you found this concept to be true in your research and experience in this space?

[00:20:10] Christian Billinger: Yes, I think it becomes, you know, it’s difficult to put numbers on these things or find sort of empirical data to back it up.

[00:20:17] Christian Billinger: But yes, the idea that, you know, once you’ve started moving up this ladder of consumption, that it’s very difficult to sort of step back down again, I think makes a lot of sense. And this is my personal opinion, but I would think it’s partly to do with the fact, the sort of functional aspects of these products, right?

[00:20:35] Christian Billinger: Because even though they are supposed to be singular and not to be compared to other products, often they do have, you know, superior product characteristics. So if you look at a Loro Piana cashmere sweater or many of these other products, objectively, they are very high quality. I think that’s one aspect of it.

[00:20:51] Christian Billinger: And then you have the other aspect, which is more social and to do with prestige, right? So once you’ve sort of entered into the realms of the prestige that comes with buying these products and services and, and the access you get through invites to parties and travel and exclusive events and right. I think it’s very difficult to sort of step back from that.

[00:21:11] Christian Billinger: And I think you see this idea as being employed in other businesses that aren’t necessarily traditional luxury businesses. So if you look at the airlines, for instance, and the idea of, you know, reward tickets and companion tickets. I think many of us have had this experience where, you know, that’s the first time you maybe get on a plane and you get a business or a first class seat.

[00:21:30] Christian Billinger: And then, you know, next time you may actually consider, should I be paying for that? Because the experience was so special. And having experienced it, I don’t want to go back to what I had before that. So yeah, I think it makes a lot of sense. And that clearly makes these businesses more robust in a way, because all these high spending consumers, I think, in fact, the example Kapferer talks about is that even when you look at sort of high and ultra high net worth individuals, they are more likely to cut back on essentials than they are on their luxury spending, because that just isn’t an option.

[00:22:00] Christian Billinger: I don’t know what the numbers are, Clay, but I think it makes a lot of sense. And it’s sort of, it fits nicely with, you know, my sort of impression and understanding of consumer dynamics in this industry.

[00:22:09] Clay Finck: So another one of the interesting things just about these world class luxury companies is that they just seem to break all the rules of business and they’re somehow able to get away with it.

[00:22:20] Clay Finck: In fact, Kapferer put together what he called the 24 anti laws of marketing that have been utilized by the world’s most profitable luxury companies. So Christian and I are going to be getting into a few of these to better understand this industry. The first anti law of marketing is forget about positioning.

[00:22:39] Clay Finck: Luxury is not comparative. And this implies that luxury is really just in a league of its own and doesn’t want the consumer to be comparing it to any other brands. You’ve got into this a little bit, so I’m not sure if there’s any other comments you have just speaking to the importance of uniqueness within a luxury product.

[00:22:58] Christian Billinger: Yeah, I think it comes back to the concept of these products being singular, right? I guess what I would add is the entire, it’s not just about the product and the advertising, but it’s the entire business model. So if you look at the way brands like LV now, Hermes and Chanel, the way they retail the product, for instance, you know, they control the value chain.

[00:23:17] Christian Billinger: They’re highly vertically integrated. So they can make sure that no competing products, so to speak, are available, right? So they can really sort of push this idea of singularity because they control that value chain. And it comes back to the way these products are being marketed. So I think yes, the rule number one fits very nicely with a few of the sort of themes or unique aspects of the luxury business that we’ve talked about.

[00:23:41] Christian Billinger: I should say that in some ways. Some of the companies you see in the luxury space may or may not be breaking one or two of these rules these days. I think since Kapferer wrote the book, some things have changed. I think with some of these groups, especially LVMH, because of the scale they’re now at, you know, some of these rules, which we may come back to, aren’t perhaps being followed quite as closely as they were.

[00:24:02] Christian Billinger: So the idea, for instance, of do not sort of use any kind of celebrity involvement or celebrity endorsement in your advertising, I think clearly If you look at brands like LV, that is no longer the case and there’s one or two other ones. I guess the internet distribution aspect, I think, is another one where you could argue that some of these companies no longer just communicate or advertise online, but they also sell meaningful volumes of products online.

[00:24:26] Christian Billinger: And so, but I think on the whole, when I go through the list of the 24, the vast majority of them still seem to hold on, especially where I would argue, you know, for the companies that we consider to be the highest quality and truest to the luxury model, almost all of them still hold. So I think they’re a very interesting set of anti rules or anti laws, and actually they’re also useful for looking at other businesses, you know, be it Apple or Ferrari or, you know, a Remy or, or many other examples of businesses that seem to be operating according to these anti laws.

[00:24:56] Clay Finck: So with regards to the celebrities, you know, you have the Nike’s of the world paying celebrities millions and millions of dollars to wear their product. But in the terms of these luxury companies, you know, ideally they want these celebrities just to be wearing their products and showcasing it without, you know, having to necessarily pay them or put their face on a commercial or whatnot.

[00:25:14] Clay Finck: Is that correct?

[00:25:16] Christian Billinger: Exactly. I think that’s what they would like. And if you look at the case of Hermes, that is what they’re getting because they don’t do any endorsements or, and they certainly wouldn’t pay anyone to sort of expose their products. I don’t know the details in Louis Vuitton’s case. You know, when you look at their campaigns with Nadal and Federer or with Messi and Ronaldo and, I don’t know what the details are in terms of the sort of financial side of things, and I’m not necessarily saying that it’s a bad thing, but I think it has changed the way the business operates or the way they sort of communicate with the consumers somewhat.

[00:25:47] Christian Billinger: And if you look at their involvement in the Olympics this summer in Paris, I think on some level, you could argue that partly at least they look a little bit more like traditional large consumer goods groups. Because also if you look at the other big sort of names that are, you know, major sponsors of the event, they are historically, there are companies like Coca Cola and P& G.

[00:26:05] Christian Billinger: And I wouldn’t want to bet against Bernard Arnault. He I’m sure he knows what he’s doing, but I think it may, for some of the brands, at least it may over time change the dynamics and the way we should analyze them. I think it’s too early for that, but it’s certainly one thing to keep an eye on. Will LVMH still be following these anti laws in five and 10 and 15 years time?

[00:26:26] Christian Billinger: Yeah. I’m more confident that the likes of Chanel and Hermes will having said that, you know, there’s other successful ways of running a business, but it may require us to change the lens we use to analyze these companies somewhat.

[00:26:39] Clay Finck: Yeah, you’re getting to kind of anti law marketing number four there, which is keep non enthusiasts out.

[00:26:45] Clay Finck: There’s this slippery slope where a luxury company is like any other company in that they want to grow, but they have to be very careful and thoughtful of their growth. And part of the appeal of luxury is being exclusive. You can’t be an exclusive company if you’re, you know, going to the Olympics and trying to appeal to a broad mass audience, because you know, if you release new products that are at say a lower price point.

[00:27:10] Clay Finck: You know, that may lose the appeal of your original product category. So could you speak more to anti law of marketing number four, which is keep non enthusiasts out?

[00:27:21] Christian Billinger: Yeah. So just to touch on what you said now, I think if you spoke to management of these companies, they would say that there’s a very sort of clear price ladder.

[00:27:29] Christian Billinger: Right, and that they’re able and segmentation and that they’re able to sell products like cosmetics and perfumes for customer recruitment, and they would sell these through different channels than the channels through which they sell their sort of very highly priced handbags and apparel, et cetera. So I think they would argue that you can do both.

[00:27:49] Christian Billinger: That remains to be seen, of course, in terms of keep the non enthusiasts out. Yeah, historically, the idea with luxury has been that you need to focus on scarcity. And if there isn’t real scarcity, you need to create scarcity, right? You need to restrict supply of these products. So there’s been a question mark around this for a long time now for brands like LV, for instance.

[00:28:11] Christian Billinger: And if you put the question to the company, they will say, we’ve been getting this question for the last 20 years. We were getting this when LV was a 500 million brand. We’re still getting this question. But of course, at some point you will run up to that sort of critical level. I think what some now argue is that it’s more about discovery than scarcity.

[00:28:32] Christian Billinger: So this comes back to the idea of making it somewhat difficult for the customer to access your product or service, right? And that is in fact, part of the appeal of these products and services. So if you look at our mess, for instance, to take an example that most people are familiar with the way you get an allocation or the way you get access to, you know, the Birkins and the Kelly’s is that you need to have, you need to establish a relationship.

[00:28:54] Christian Billinger: You need to be buying other products, right? There are certain things you need to sort of take off to get to the point where you can actually buy 1 of those bags. You know, some people would argue that process of discovery is more important than the scarcity as such. And then there’s a couple of other aspects I would touch on there.

[00:29:11] Christian Billinger: One is that for the historically, at least these brands have been able to expand geographically, right? So even if the product or the brand was becoming highly visible in some markets, they could expand into some other part of the world. I think they’re running up against a limit there. Certainly if you look at the very large brands.

[00:29:26] Christian Billinger: So if you look at LV, Dior, Chanel and Hermes I think. You know, for them, that’s becoming increasingly difficult. And then you have the question of visibility. So, you know, with some of these products, a very large proportion of purchases are made by a relatively small number of consumers. And so if you look at handbags as an example, in many cases, that means that only one of these bags will be visible at any given point in time, right?

[00:29:50] Christian Billinger: Now, some would argue that might change if you have secondhand retailers, and if you’ve had experience here, like rent the runway and all of these businesses so far, it’s been very difficult for them to sort of build any momentum. But I think it’s certainly one thing to watch. I would like to think a company like MS is better protected because simply for the fact that you cannot purchase these, the most desired products, if you haven’t gone through that sort of process.

[00:30:15] Christian Billinger: But this growth paradox, I think, is one of the key questions for any long term investor in the sector, as in, for how long can you grow at these kinds of rates and still be perceived as an exclusive or operate as a luxury kind of business model? And it’s a real question, and it’s probably one of the top two or three things that I worry about when I look at the very long term sort of outlook for these companies.

[00:30:37] Clay Finck: Yeah, the point on scarcity is quite a paradox because we really live in a world of abundance. Ferrari, for example, they produce somewhere between 7 to 10,000 cars per year. And just for reference, Ford produces north of 4 million cars per year. And then from the book, they pulled a quote from the Hermes CEO.

[00:30:58] Clay Finck: He’s been on records for saying that when a product sells too much, we stop producing it. I was actually doing some reading on Hermes before this, and I believe the Birkin bags, they stated in an earnings call that they’re producing as many as they can, but it’s just such a time intensive process. And that only so many people in the world know how to make these bags.

[00:31:17] Clay Finck: So maybe to some extent, not everybody is purposely limiting how many products they’re able to produce. But yes, scarcity is certainly a very important factor to this because if everyone has access to that, then, you know, it loses its appeal as well.

[00:31:32] Christian Billinger: I think that sort of touches on what Kapferer to refer to the book talks about.

[00:31:36] Christian Billinger: I think he calls it the dream equation where he says, you know, one of the key things in this business is to increase awareness of the brand at a higher rate than the penetration of the brand, right? So you want to make more and more not necessarily potential consumers, but you want to make more and more people aware of your brand.

[00:31:52] Christian Billinger: But you don’t necessarily want to grow consumption in volume terms at the same rate. I think with our mess, for instance, they do manage, they may be producing as much as they can, but they’re not growing capacity as much as they could. And so they managed that very carefully. Of course, there are restrictions, and especially for these highly vertically integrated businesses, right, in terms of access to skill, labor, especially, and I think with Hermes, you’ve also seen in recent years, while it’s an exceptional brand, they’ve had some issues with service levels and the sort of quality of the store network.

[00:32:21] Christian Billinger: So I think there are restrictions or constraints on the retail side of things as well that need to be managed carefully. But yes, it feels like some of these companies are doing a very good job at it still at scale. And in fact, I think most of the examples I’ve referred, I don’t think we’ve seen any of the big four have any big trip ups there so far.

[00:32:40] Christian Billinger: But yeah, I think over 10 years time, this will be one of the top things to watch.

[00:32:46] Clay Finck: So anti law number 13 is raise your prices as time goes on in order to increase demand. One would obviously think that increasing prices would generally mean you’re appealing to a smaller customer base, but the luxury customer base is much different than most companies.

[00:33:03] Clay Finck: How can increasing prices actually increase demand?

[00:33:08] Christian Billinger: So partly this comes back to the idea of selling a singular unique product, right? And I think part of the idea there is that you price your product so that it is perceived as being unique or singular in a way, right? And price is supposedly irrelevant.

[00:33:23] Christian Billinger: Having said that you’ve seen for some of these companies recently, they have been getting some pushback for what are perceived to be excessive price increases. So Chanel, I think is the most sort of visible example of this, where there’s been a lot of attention, at least paid to the price increases they’ve taken on some of their flat bags and through the pandemic.

[00:33:42] Christian Billinger: Having said that, when you look at their actual performance and the growth of the business. I must say it’s difficult to say whether this is just sort of social media noise or whether it’s actually genuine pushback from their consumer base. I mean, so far it seems to be the former, but we will have to see.

[00:34:00] Christian Billinger: I think, yeah, clearly in some cases, I think the pricing of these, and Kapferer talks about this in the book, the idea with, if you operate a true luxury business model is that you only ever increase prices, right? And certainly we’ve seen that in recent years, and especially with the sort of, let’s call it the best or strongest brands in the business, like Chanel and Hermes, and to some extent, some of the brands, LVMH brands, and including some smaller, lesser, perhaps less visible brands like Loro Piana.

[00:34:29] Christian Billinger: So yes, the way you think about price here is clearly very different from most other businesses. And I guess as you know, if you compare this to what we said about the premium idea of a premium business, for instance, there you can compare product features and you can therefore look at what you’re getting versus what you’re paying.

[00:34:43] Christian Billinger: And I think one key element of these businesses and these products is that it is very difficult to compare. And in fact, usually the consumer doesn’t even want to make that comparison. Right. So, yes, they’re very different dynamics. We will have to see whether, you know, some of these price increases we’ve seen in recent years will turn out to sort of be excessive and whether that will have any impact on the brands.

[00:35:03] Christian Billinger: But so far, I don’t see any evidence of that.

[00:35:06] Clay Finck: And an important point to tie in here is that luxury companies aren’t typically looking to reduce costs just for the sake of, you know, increasing their profit margins because typically this can lead to a lower quality product or service or experience.

[00:35:23] Clay Finck: Ideally, you know, they want to increase their price, but also increase the value that’s being provided as well. And you know, approaching it that way, looking at how can I provide more value instead of, you know, how can I increase the profit by decreasing costs?

[00:35:37] Christian Billinger: Yeah, and I think it also comes back to the idea of heritage, right?

[00:35:40] Christian Billinger: And sort of cultural identity. So if you look at these predominantly European brands, part of what you’re selling here is the idea of take some of these French brands, for instance, you know, you’re selling the idea of these, you know, French heritage and French traditions and French culture, right? So the idea that you would outsource that production or relocate that production to a low cost country, I think it just doesn’t fit with the DNA of these businesses, right?

[00:36:02] Christian Billinger: Yeah. And then there’s another aspect of that, which is that the strong have been getting stronger in this industry and have therefore been able to sort of the likes of LVMH and Hermes and Chanel, et cetera, have been taking significant amounts of market share in recent years. And therefore, you know, and it’s a virtuous circle, so they’ve been better able to reinvest in product quality and branding.

[00:36:23] Christian Billinger: And, and I think they have more headroom in terms of. In the case of many of these brands producing all of their volumes in sort of high cost locations, like in France or in Italy or other parts of Western Europe.

[00:36:36] Clay Finck: So the last anti law I wanted to touch on here was number 24, which says just sell marginally on the Internet.

[00:36:43] Clay Finck: So e-commerce is, of course, a very important part of our economy today. So they’d be leaving a lot on the table if they just never set up an e commerce store. But part of the appeal of these luxury brands is, you know, the experience of going into the store and speaking with their representative that tells a story and explains that singularity that you’re talking about.

[00:37:03] Clay Finck: What’s the consensus on selling luxury online?

[00:37:07] Christian Billinger: I think part of it is that there is no real consensus, I think, so far, right? Historically, these products, as you said, have been deemed not to be a good fit for the online model, right? Having said that, Penetration of online, this will vary hugely by segment and price point and brand, but if you look at the overall personal luxury goods market, as we defined it earlier, I think that number has gone from rough numbers, but from somewhere around 10 percent 5 years ago, 5 or 7 years ago to say 25 percent now, so clearly penetration has increased hugely.

[00:37:38] Christian Billinger: There’s quite a few sort of pure play online businesses in this space, but generally they’ve had a very difficult time, especially coming out of the pandemic. So you look at Farfetch, Richemont have an investment in Yoox Net-a-Porter. They’ve also had a very difficult time. The strong brands have been very reluctant to move any of their distribution online, but they now have some of their own brand.

[00:38:02] Christian Billinger: If you look at LV, for instance, There is some distribution online of certain products, but it’s very selective and I think one of the points that Kapferer makes in his book is that it’s perfectly fine for these companies to communicate and to market or sort of engage in brand building online, but the distribution part is much more difficult or challenging.

[00:38:23] Christian Billinger: And so I’d say it’s certainly happening. Kapferer makes a point that it isn’t a very good fit because you’re missing out on a few key elements of the luxury experience and especially fiscal retail, which is still unusually, which is hugely sort of important for these brands. And if anything, I would argue you’ve seen the opposite in this space where the level of investment in, you know, the store network has been extraordinary in recent years.

[00:38:45] Christian Billinger: And you might’ve seen many of these companies spending huge amounts of money on very prime real estate. So, you know, in the case of LVMH, there’s a couple of very significant investments they’ve made in Paris and New York and similarly for Prada and Gucci, right? This has been all over the news. So I think it seems like there’s a bit of polarization here as well, where the sort of true luxury players are really holding out and they’re very selective in the way they distribute online.

[00:39:11] Christian Billinger: And so I think it’s difficult to sort of answer this generally for the whole space, but it’s certainly happening in some ways. It may also help crystallize the true luxury players from the rest of the group.

[00:39:23] Clay Finck: I wanted to transition here to talk more about just the broader luxury market. Maybe you could speak to how fast some of these markets are growing, what markets are more mature, and maybe which markets present opportunity for growth.

[00:39:38] Clay Finck: Speaking with some guests on the show, I’ve seen kind of China was like a growth story for a lot of just the broader economy throughout the two thousands and becoming more mature these days. But now India seems to be, you know, more so on the rise. So I’m curious if India has any role to play in the luxury space.

[00:39:55] Christian Billinger: I’m sure it will do. I think certainly for now. And when you speak to many of these companies, they will say that the next China is still China. So I think many of them feel that there’s a lot of opportunities still there. In terms of the big picture, you know, if you come back to the personal luxury goods market of say 400 billion or so I mean, the big growth drivers in terms of category, if you look at the last decade, for instance, has been certainly the leather goods.

[00:40:18] Christian Billinger: That’s been one of the highest growing categories. And on the other hand, if you look at watches, that’s been a much more difficult part of the sort of sector. So there’s differentials in terms of category growth rates. And then in terms of geographies, of course, as I said, Chinese consumers have accounted for something like two thirds of growth in the sector.

[00:40:36] Christian Billinger: So that remains a hugely Important part of this market and most of these companies still feel that there’s a lot of untapped potential there. India is very interesting, not just for the luxury groups, but generally speaking, I think there’s so much positive sentiment around. I mean, that may have changed somewhat, I think, depending on the way you look at it, the recent elections, but on the whole, there’s been really positive sort of momentum there.

[00:40:57] Christian Billinger: I think it’s just that the base effect means that for now that will, and for the foreseeable future, that will remain a much less significant driver. If you look at the last decade, the U. S. has been, depending on category, but mid single digit growth, or a bit less than that, and Western Europe has been relatively flattish, so there’s a lot of differential in terms of geography and category.

[00:41:19] Christian Billinger: You know, one of the nice things the large diversified conglomerates is you’re getting some sort of, well, one, you’re getting diversified exposure, right? So you’re getting different categories and different price points and geographies. But also, as I mentioned earlier, the strong have been getting stronger.

[00:41:33] Christian Billinger: So if you look at LVMH, for instance, between the financial crisis and the pandemic, they averaged about 10 percent organic growth, which is much higher than the overall market. So you’ve been getting a lot of outperformance from these big groups, right? And so there’s a number of things to consider, right?

[00:41:48] Christian Billinger: The overall market. The divergence you’re seeing between geographies and categories and also the sort of large diversified conglomerates versus the small, call it independent or family controlled players, many of which are Italian and many of which have struggled, I think, to actually have enough resource to invest in this, in the critical store network and fiscal retail.

[00:42:09] Christian Billinger: Also, There’s a number of things to consider when you sort of try to figure out where you want to be exposed.

[00:42:15] Clay Finck: So this might be a really unfair question. Who do you think is the typical luxury consumer? Maybe this would be helpful to the audience just to get a sense of proportion of the population sort of falls into this category.

[00:42:29] Christian Billinger: So as we touched on earlier that these companies will argue, certainly the large diversified groups would argue that it’s not primarily the very rich, it’s the mass affluent. But it does seem like a small proportion of their customer base accounts for a large proportion of purchases. The 2 percent of customers driving 40 percent of purchases I think speaks to that fact.

[00:42:52] Christian Billinger: And then of course you have differences between geographies. So I, I think we touched on this earlier, but the fact that for instance in China, you’re looking at a very different typical luxury consumer than you would do in Western markets. And also you have the fact that these things tend to sort of change over time.

[00:43:08] Christian Billinger: So, you know, the average age and other sort of characteristics of the consumer base here will have changed over time. So I think apart from that play, it’s probably difficult to say much about who the typical consumer is because within that sort of mass affluent group, there’s such a wide variety. What you can say is that some of these companies, if we speak about for our purposes, I guess, the focus is on the listed groups.

[00:43:32] Christian Billinger: What you can say is they certainly sell to different kinds of demographics, right? So I mentioned Chanel, Hermes and Cucinelli. Certainly they will sell to you know, if you look at average earnings and net worth and age, that will look very different, right? From many of the brands in the LVMH group. So that’s probably also as an investor, I think that’s relevant to keep in mind when you’re trying to figure out where do I want to be exposed here.

[00:43:54] Clay Finck: Circling back to pricing, I wanted to share a piece here from the book from Kapfer. When we evoke the word luxury, the adjective expensive immediately comes to mind, and yet it is probably the relationship between luxury and price that things become most complex and surprising. At a conceptual level, we know that luxury is translated in a product through a high symbolic value.

[00:44:18] Clay Finck: The symbolic value essential to luxury is very difficult to quantify and in any case is highly relative. It cannot be given a precise figure and yet luxury must be paid for and therefore it must have a price. How do you think about the pricing of luxury products?

[00:44:35] Christian Billinger: I think generally speaking, it comes back to the points we’ve made earlier about the fact that these products are not prone to comparison, right?

[00:44:42] Christian Billinger: And the other thing to keep in mind is probably speaking that the competitive set is very broad for these products or services, right? So I think one of the examples. Kapferer makes this, if you’re looking at some of the prestige champagnes, for instance, what is the competitive set there? If you’re looking to purchase one of these as a gift, you know, you may also be looking at a piece of jewelry, or you may be looking at a painting or an experience of some kind.

[00:45:08] Christian Billinger: So I think it’s much, but he actually puts a number on this, I think. I can’t speak to whether, you know, how, sort of, what the empirical basis is here. I think he talks about a minimum for somewhat comparable products, a minimum price premium of 30 percent for a luxury product, but it probably should be no more than 100%, I think he says.

[00:45:26] Christian Billinger: I don’t know how he gets to those numbers. It seems very sort of precise. I mean, what’s the empirical evidence? Well, one thing to keep in mind is that, of course, some of these are seen as stores of value. So if you look at resale values for some of these for some of the strongest brands, of course, they’re trading at a premium or trading at sort of par in the resale market.

[00:45:47] Christian Billinger: So if you look at the Birkins and the Kelly’s and, but also of course, when you look at some of the prestige or, or I should say luxury watches. And so that has a real significance for the way you price your product, right? Because to many consumers, you know, that means that these are seen as investments or at least that sort of eliminates the downside risk, because if you want to offload some of your collection, you can do so at perhaps even with a gain.

[00:46:12] Christian Billinger: So I think that matters. And then for the global brands, they also need to manage these price sort of interregional price differences, right? Because of course, for many years, we’ve had the phenomenon of the Chinese professional shoppers, you know, coming over to Europe and other parts of Asia to bring a lot of product back to China.

[00:46:30] Christian Billinger: So the European brands have had to be very careful about how they managed that as well. So some of these are more to do with brand and identity and the broad competitive set. Some of it is to do with resale values and sort of managing that equation. And some of it is more, say, call it operational or more short to medium term commercial.

[00:46:49] Christian Billinger: So, you know, without being able to put numbers on these things, I think these are some of the considerations of managing these brands successfully from a pricing point of view.

[00:46:58] Clay Finck: Yes, certainly signals pricing power when your customers can sell what it is you’re selling in the secondary market at a price higher, you know, the next day.

[00:47:08] Clay Finck: So the well known luxury brands are very large companies and it leads me to want to potentially look at some of the smaller names, but this can be a difficult line to cross and a bit dangerous because there’s a fine line between true luxury and we’ll call it the rest of the pack. Okay. When looking at a smaller name, do you think there’s maybe some pitfalls you’d watch out for to maybe help distinguish other than some of the things we’ve mentioned already in trying to identify true luxury versus the rest of the pack?

[00:47:40] Christian Billinger: Yeah, so one of the difficulties I think is heritage and track record. So small doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s a recent brand, right? But if it is, then I think that’s a real something to keep in mind here, right? And many of these are first generation still. So if you look at a Cuccinelli, for instance, which, you know, where you haven’t seen, and in fact, LVMH, although very large is in a similar situation where they still haven’t proven themselves as multi generational businesses.

[00:48:06] Christian Billinger: Another, so I think governance and succession is one thing to keep in mind when you look at some of the smaller, call them independent players. I think another one is, and we’ve seen many of the Italian groups, several of whom are now part of the large French conglomerates, which like a Bulgari, for instance, have struggled, I think, to fund, you know, both in terms of financial and sort of human resources to fund the certainly international expansion of their store networks.

[00:48:31] Christian Billinger: So I think that’s another thing to keep in mind, or do they have the resource and sort of ability to grow internationally? And then thirdly, the risk profile of these companies will vary depending on if you’re looking at, so when you say, you know, smaller independent player, most probably you’re looking at a much more focused portfolio, both in terms of geography, but also in terms of product range, right?

[00:48:53] Christian Billinger: So, of course, you know, if you get it right on the upside, there’s much more opportunity, but equally, you would probably be much more dependent on often their model brand. So they, you know, you look at LVMH with 75 or 80 brands in there, right. Many of these smaller independent groups will have, you know, one brand and a very narrow product range, and they may also be quite limited or focused geographically.

[00:49:15] Christian Billinger: That’s not to say that they’re not equally good businesses, but it can have a real impact on the risk profile. I would probably focus on those aspects.

[00:49:23] Clay Finck: So one of the things that sparked the idea for this episode was that my co host, Stig Brodersen, he had told me that Hermes was probably the best company he’s ever analyzed.

[00:49:35] Clay Finck: And when he says something like that, it really grabs my attention. This is a company that essentially sells one of their main products is the Birkin bag, which sells for 10 or 20, 000 euros plus. I’ll just be clear that him or I don’t own this stock. We’re just talking about the business itself. And the valuation is a whole nother discussion.

[00:49:52] Clay Finck: And you talked about the heritage and sort of the family ownership of some of these luxury companies. Hermes, they’re on their sixth generation of family ownership. And they were started all the way back in 1837, which in itself is another interesting aspect of this company. But it can be painful for value investors to see a company like Hermes trading at a PE of around 50.

[00:50:15] Clay Finck: What are some of the things investors should take into consideration when looking at the valuation of luxury companies in particular that, you know, make them just fundamentally different than when you’re analyzing other companies?

[00:50:29] Christian Billinger: So personally, I don’t necessarily think Hermes is the best business I’ve ever looked at.

[00:50:33] Christian Billinger: I think it’s very good. I think it’s an exceptional brand. I think the business actually, although very good, I think potentially isn’t being run as well as it could be, which is, you know, an interesting conversation in itself. But if you look at the store network and the customer experience, and I think some of that is intentional coming back to Kapferer.

[00:50:51] Christian Billinger: He talks about dominate your customer and make it difficult for the customer to buy the product and all these things. So, and I think people inside the business would acknowledge this, that, you know, there are some aspects of the business that could probably be better managed. But having said that in terms of valuation, so generally speaking, valuations reflect, I think on the whole relatively well, the sort of differentials you see in growth rates and resilience, to some extent, the strength of the balance sheets of these companies.

[00:51:17] Christian Billinger: And so of course, if you look at the top end, you look at Hermes trading on 45 or 50 times earnings, right? And then you have the large conglomerates. If you take LVMH trading in the low twenties, and then you have at the sort of lower end, you have companies like Burberry and a number of other examples that are, you know, call them turnaround candidates or less well mannered and some wouldn’t even include them as being true luxury businesses, but for reference.

[00:51:43] Christian Billinger: They’re trading in the low teams, perhaps. So, you know, there are significant differences within this group. And I should say, you know, we’ve been invested in these for a long time, but we haven’t been buying Hermes or LVMH for a long time. And in fact, if anything, we’ve slightly reduced these holdings in the last year or so.

[00:51:59] Christian Billinger: Clearly, they’re not as attractively valued as they were. Yeah, I think on the whole, the market sort of clearly gets the ranking in terms of quality and in terms of how well they operate a luxury business model. I think that’s reflected in their valuations. The other thing to say is that, and this is also something the book touches on is, you know, if you look at reinvestment rates, these aren’t necessarily businesses where you should just be looking at the capex statement to get a sense of how much they reinvest because of course much of their spending.

[00:52:29] Christian Billinger: Goals through OPEX go through the income statement. So you get to the question of, you know, are these companies over or under earning? And I think it’s fair to say that certainly LVMH and now Chanel is obviously not listed on the exchange, but these tend to be businesses that invest for the long term because of their shareholder structures and the culture at these companies.

[00:52:48] Christian Billinger: So I think that’s worth keeping in mind, having said that, I think they’ve had a lot of things going their way in recent years, right? Certainly through and coming out of the pandemic, we have some companies in our portfolio where we strongly feel they’re under earning. I wouldn’t include the luxury goods companies there, right?

[00:53:03] Christian Billinger: I think they’ve had a pretty good time. And on top of that, they’ve been rated quite highly by the market. So those are the broad sort of considerations. I think when it comes to valuation, of course, our mess always looks expensive, despite that it’s been an incredible investment over one and two decades and longer.

[00:53:21] Christian Billinger: Some of these companies like Burberry has, has looked inexpensive for a long time, but it’s not been a good place to be invested. And in fact, it probably in some ways it’s, it’s interesting because we’re discussing this book, I think in some ways, the valuations seem to reflect how well they follow many of these concepts and strategies.

[00:53:38] Christian Billinger: Now, I’m sure they were doing that long before the book came out, but that does mean that this is a good sort of book to be going through. I think for anyone looking to invest in the sector, because it can also give you a sense of, you know, where the real quality in this sector is.

[00:53:52] Clay Finck: You mentioned earlier the importance of, you know, the transition of ownership over time and transition to managers.

[00:54:00] Clay Finck: And when you have, say in the case of their meds, for example, they’re on their sixth generation. There’s more confidence with investors on, you know, where this business will be 25 plus years from now in terms of the new ownership and who’s going to be running the company and how the brand is going to be taken care of over time.

[00:54:16] Clay Finck: So not only is the company building trust with customers and the long tenure of that heritage, but it’s also building that trust with shareholders as well. And, you know, having that longterm mindset that endures and, you know, that is essentially implied in, in the terminal value for investors.

[00:54:33] Christian Billinger: Yeah, I agree.

[00:54:34] Christian Billinger: I think Hermes is probably the best example. If you look at the listed groups of business where you can have some confidence in the sort of succession and the future governance of that business. And then I think with most of the others, to some extent with LVMH, certainly with some of the other businesses in this sector where you have a much more institutional shareholder structure, I think you’re much more dependent on external professional management coming in to run the business.

[00:54:57] Christian Billinger: Yeah. And so you look at Burberry, for instance, and the sort of turnover they’ve seen when it comes to management and creative lead. And so that’s something else to consider. But yeah, I think the big one to watch here is of course the, you know, what will happen at LVMH when you look at the list of groups, but you’re right.

[00:55:11] Christian Billinger: I mean, they haven’t so far, haven’t proven themselves as a multi generational business. So we’ll have to see having said that it’s a large diversified group. So I think in some ways the nature of that business provides some protection. Yes, certainly. That’s a big, important question for anyone investing in this industry.

[00:55:28] Clay Finck: Historically, what have you seen in the luxury space during recessions? Is there cases where there’s a sharp pullback in demand for these types of products or how has that looked historically?

[00:55:40] Christian Billinger: It’s no doubt a cyclical industry. And so the most recent example would be, I mean, it’s a very unusual experience, but if you look at 2020, I think for LVMH, their top line was down something like 15 percent and their EBIT was down almost 30%, right?

[00:55:54] Christian Billinger: So clearly now that’s an unusual, that’s perhaps not a normal recession, but I think it does show you that there’s also a lot of operating leverage in these businesses because they have a meaningful, you know, they have production facilities, but especially they have a store network, right? And so you certainly have an earnings cycle in these businesses.

[00:56:13] Christian Billinger: The other thing to keep in mind is it doesn’t sort of hit everyone, but the same magnitude or impact. So I think we mentioned this earlier that if you look at recent experience is that the strong have been getting stronger and certainly the brand selling to the wealthier consumer. Like the Chanels and Hermes, and Cucinelli.

[00:56:30] Christian Billinger: They have been much better able to weather any downturn. So yes, it’s cyclical. I think as an investor, that’s part of the opportunity, right? You get earning cycles, you’re exposed to the economy, to asset values. And also you get cycles of sentiment here, right? Whether people are concerned about tariffs or what have you, but I think as a long term investor, if you’re confident in the quality of these businesses, that’s welcome.

[00:56:52] Christian Billinger: That’s where the opportunities are.

[00:56:54] Clay Finck: Great. Well, that’s all we had for this first episode on a luxury primer. Christian and I will be talking in next week’s episode on some of his holdings in the luxury space. So be sure to come back and tune into that next episode that comes out a week from now. So Christian, before I let you go, I want to give you a chance to let the audience know how they can connect with you if they’d like and learn more about what you’re up to.

[00:57:18] Christian Billinger: Yeah, sure. I think the best place to go is to our website, which is billingerforvaltning.se/ and there’s articles and podcasts and you can see our holdings and you can find contact details. So yeah, I’d love it if anyone wants to discuss this or other topics.

[00:57:33] Clay Finck: Wonderful. All of that linked in the show notes for those that are interested.

[00:57:36] Clay Finck: Christian, thanks so much. I look forward to chatting again soon.

[00:57:40] Christian Billinger: Thank you. Look forward to it. Thanks again.

# Transcript 4

[00:00:00] Clay Finck: On today’s episode, I’m joined by Shree Viswanathan for a stock deep dive on Hermes. Shree owns Hermes and his fund SVN Capital, and he takes a long term, concentrated, patient approach to investing in public equities. Hermes is one of the most valuable luxury brands in the world, renowned for its high quality craftsmanship and rich heritage.

[00:00:21] Clay Finck: The brand is known for its iconic products such as the Birkin and Kelly bags, silk scarves, and horse related items. Since the IPO in 1993, shares of Hermes have compounded at 20.6 percent excluding dividends, while the S&P 500 has had a total return of just 10.4 percent over the same period. Hermes was founded in 1837, and it’s still managed by the founding family who owns 67 percent of the shares.

[00:00:50] Clay Finck: These shares are controlled by three branches of the founding family, and combined, the shares are worth roughly 155 billion, making them one of the wealthiest families in the world. During this episode, Shree and I give a business overview of Hermes, we share the story of the attempted takeover of Bernard Arnault. We discussed the strength of Hermes moat, the growth opportunities that lie ahead, their approach to capital allocation, their very rich valuation, and the most important risks going forward.

[00:01:21] Clay Finck: This was one of my favorite episodes I’ve recorded on the show, so I really hope you enjoyed as well as Shree shares a ton of fascinating insights during our conversation. Whether you’re interested in Hermes or not, I think there’s a lot we can learn about such a company that can somehow be implemented into our own business or own personal lives in some form or fashion.

[00:01:40] Clay Finck: With that, I bring you today’s episode discussing the luxury icon, Hermes.

[00:01:48] Intro: Celebrating 10 years and more than 150 million downloads. You are listening to The Investor’s Podcast Network. Since 2014, we studied the financial markets and read the books that influence self-made billionaires the most. We keep you informed and prepared for the unexpected. Now for your host, Clay Finck.

[00:02:16] Clay Finck: Welcome to The Investor’s Podcast. I’m your host, Clay Fink. And today I’m happy to welcome back my friend, Shree Viswanathan. Shree, it’s great to have you back on the show.

[00:02:25] Shree Viswanathan: Clay, it’s a pleasure to be back again. Thank you for inviting me and your pronunciation of my last name is perfect. I like that.

[00:02:35] Clay Finck: We do our research here at The Investor’s Podcast.

[00:02:38] Clay Finck: So I’ve really been looking forward to this conversation for quite some time. I actually just visited Austin with a friend back in June and I made it a point to visit a Hermes store because I knew I’d be having this conversation with you. And over the years, I’ve looked at a number of different companies from an investor point of view and just being a host here on the show and doing what I need to do through interviews and such.

[00:03:01] Clay Finck: Every once in a while. I come across a company that just for lack of a better phrase, I think is just cut from a different cloth, whether it be the business model or especially the management team in many cases and how they manage the business. And this year I started to dig into Hermes. And I felt that this was just another case where I really wanted to understand the business better.
[00:03:21] Clay Finck: And I think there’s some lessons that can be learned from studying such a company. I really hope the audience understands where Shree and I are coming from here and seeking to learn more about a company from an investor’s point of view, because in some ways, I think it can be a bit awkward to talk about a luxury company like Hermes, because generally our audience is full of value investors, many of which are hardwired to look for bargains, whether it be in the stock market or when they’re shopping or whatever they’re purchasing.

[00:03:48] Clay Finck: So if you aren’t familiar with this company, you might go to their website and see that they’re selling very expensive watches, thousand dollar belts, 10, 000 bags. So I wanted to bring Shree on the show to help shed more light on the company for our investing audience.

[00:04:03] Shree Viswanathan: Yeah, no, thank you for thinking about me as it related to Hermes.

[00:04:08] Shree Viswanathan: Yeah, it is one of my portfolio companies. I’ve owned it for a few years and it’s just as you mentioned, it’s a fabulous, it’s a true definition of a quality business. We’ll get into the details of how I define quality and why Hermes is still an interesting proposition for your followers and other investors, but yeah, nicely put cut from a different cloth.

[00:04:33] Shree Viswanathan: I would just add cut from a different leather.

[00:04:36] Clay Finck: That’s right. Cut from a different leather. So how about we just start with a general overview of the company?

[00:04:42] Shree Viswanathan: Winston Churchill said, the farther back you can look, the farther forward you’re likely to see. Fortunately, Hermes gives us more than 187 years to look back, although we have a much shorter history of only 30 plus years to look back since it went public in 1993.

[00:05:03] Shree Viswanathan: In the past, Clay, when I’ve talked to you, I’ve seen this book, 100 Bagger, by my friend, Chris Mayer, right behind you. That’s a fabulous book. In that book, he says that on average, it takes about 25 years for a company to become 100 Bagger. He was right on the button. Hermes took 25 years since going public in 1993 to become a hundred bagger in 2018.

[00:05:29] Shree Viswanathan: It’s gone up more than four x in the last six years since 2018, for a total return of more than 400 times. Since IPO I’m sure we’ll get into some of the quantitative features of the business later. Let me get to the qualitative overview that you just asked. Hermès Paris is a prestigious luxury brand renowned for its exceptional craftsmanship and rich heritage.

[00:05:56] Shree Viswanathan: As I just mentioned, the name is Hermès Paris, not just Hermès, although outside of France and many of the stores, it just goes by Hermès, you know, the great Emerson in his essay titled The Self Reliance. It says an institution is the lengthened shadow of one man. Hermes is a very long shadow of Thierry Hermes, who founded it in 1837 as a harness workshop.

[00:06:24] Shree Viswanathan: The company was selling high quality saddles and other leather goods to Europeans and ended up being European nobility over time. Over the years, the company has evolved into what we now know as a global luxury powerhouse. Maintaining its reputation for exclusivity and quality. It’s celebrated for its meticulous attention to detail and the artistry involved in its products.

[00:06:50] Shree Viswanathan: The brand emphasizes artisanal skills with many items handcrafted. The commitment to quality has positioned Hermes as one of the most valuable luxury brands globally, consistently ranking high in brand valuation studies. Hermes. You know, a few weeks back or months back, maybe you talked to my friend, Christian Billinger about the LVMH and Kapferer’s book, The Luxury Strategy, and I’m sure we’ll get into those as well.

[00:07:20] Shree Viswanathan: But luxury, this is probably a good time to kind of also define luxury as I’m defining the qualitative features of Hermes. Luxury has always been morally condemned. And in ancient Greece, it was the philosophers and today it’s more the moralists and politicians, be that as it may, luxury is here to stay.

[00:07:43] Shree Viswanathan: You know, we have a very large and rapidly growing sector with both public and private companies. But given this moral condemnation, it also is appropriate to highlight that luxury as a concept has been around in the old continent, in Europe and to a certain extent in Asia. It’s actually relatively new in the U.S. So what’s luxury? And there are many, many definitions of this word luxury. But one that I really liked was from Bernard Arnault, the CEO of LVMH, said it’s the ordinary of extraordinary people, and the extraordinary of ordinary people, essentially gets to the heart of luxury strategy. Let me come back to providing this qualitative overview.

[00:08:30] Shree Viswanathan: You know, Hermes as a company has 16 métiers. It’s a French word, it’s essentially a specialized métier, it’s a specialized craft or area of expertise within the company. Each métier represents a distinct domain of craftsmanship and creativity. We’ll come back to that in details as to various different components of this.

[00:08:52] Shree Viswanathan: But the products that Hermes now produces falls into four buckets, essentially. Leather goods, which is the largest within the company, accounts for about 50 percent of sales, features the iconic brand names like the Birkin bag and the Kelly bags. Number two is the ready to wear. That’s about 23 percent of sales.

[00:09:13] Shree Viswanathan: And that includes clothing and accessories for both men and women. Number three is silk and textiles. That makes approximately 10 percent of sales. In the olden days, it was known for its luxurious scarves and ties and other silk products. But as leather has kind of become big within the company, within luxury in general, silk and textiles has come down to about 10%.

[00:09:40] Shree Viswanathan: And then the final category, which is sort of all encompassing is, what’s defined as watches, jewelry, and other home goods. And now that’s the business end of it. What started off as a French company selling to the French more than 187 years ago has now ended up as a French company that exports almost 90 percent of its products.

[00:10:01] Shree Viswanathan: They still keep about 75 percent of the production within the country. And that’s not by accident. That’s a big part of the bigger strategy. Currently, they have 54 production sites across the country with 11 regions, 23, 000 employees, 7, 000 of them are artisans, and they sell it through their controlled the distribution mechanism, about 300 stores around 45 countries.

[00:10:28] Clay Finck: Shree, as I’ve been involved in the podcasting space for coming up on three years, I’ve recognized this importance of the short term versus long-term trade off and trying to find the right balance between the two. And that balance is going to look different for each company. For the podcast, for example, we know that listeners do not like hearing ads.

[00:10:46] Clay Finck: They’re going to hear ads during this episode and they’ll likely continue to hear ads, but without ads, we wouldn’t be able to have this conversation. So inevitably it’s sort of a sacrifice we’re simply willing to make in order to provide this content for free. Now, in the case of a luxury company, they might see a lot of a demand for a product like a Birkin or a Kelly bag, and many management teams are going to be tempted to try and increase the level of production the most, as much as they can to try and boost the earnings.

[00:11:14] Clay Finck: But this can be harmful to a luxury brand if it ends up decreasing the perceived value of the brand. And I think Hermes sort of epitomizes what it means to think long term and not really make these shorter term sacrifices to boost short term earnings. So I was curious if you could speak more to this.

[00:11:33] Shree Viswanathan: That’s a wonderful question about long term. Anytime this phrase long term pops up, it piques my interest. Not to digress too much, I’m sure you’ve heard of Stuart Brand, the founder of Whole Earth Catalog. He created something called the Long Now Foundation, which is essentially seminars on long term thinking.

[00:11:53] Shree Viswanathan: It’s a wonderful platform to follow. You may already know this, and some of your followers may be interested. Back to your question, while there is no perfect count, back in 2008, bank of Korea found out that there were about 5,500 companies around the world that were more than 150 years old at more than 187 years.

[00:12:17] Shree Viswanathan: Hermes is already a part of a select group. Long-term is in its DNA for Hermes. As you know, long-term thinking is core, part of its business philosophy and strategy. To support that long term thinking, there are many factors that go into supporting that. Let me just highlight a couple of them and maybe we can address a few more as we go along.

[00:12:38] Shree Viswanathan: Quality is absolutely paramount to Hermes’. One of the important features of this long term thinking is the quality of the products. And again, allow me to digress a little bit. Walter Isaacson, in the biography of Steve Jobs, he writes about how Steve Jobs was passionate about quality of the computers.

[00:12:59] Shree Viswanathan: Steve and his father were working in building a fence around their house in California. When his father said, you know, you got to make the back of the fence that nobody will see just as good looking as the front of the fence, even though nobody will see it, you will know it. And that will show that you are dedicated to making something perfect.

[00:13:20] Shree Viswanathan: This idea stuck with Jobs. And when he made the Macintosh, he had the engineer’s names engraved inside each one of those computers. And he said real artists signed their work. No one would ever see them, but the members of the team knew that their signatures were inside. Why do I bring that Steve Jobs episode here?

[00:13:42] Shree Viswanathan: Because I sometimes wonder if this quality obsession of Hermes had an influence on Steve and how he thought about quality. While there is no direct evidence, similarities are striking, I think. When many of Hermes competitors began using sewing machines, Hermes refined the 400 year old saddle stitch so that connoisseurs could distinguish between their inevitable craftwork and mechanical sewing.

[00:14:12] Shree Viswanathan: A saddle’s underside rivals its upside. Its inside outclasses its outside. That’s the classic stamp of a quality product. You know, therein lies that nobility. Hermes products are made to last. a long time. Axel Dumas, the current CEO he says, we want our products to look even more beautiful 10 years later.

[00:14:38] Shree Viswanathan: In these types of products, there is no planned obsolescence or forcing the customer to buy a new collection because the previous ones no longer make sense. So that’s the type of commitment. That’s the type of quality that Hermes brings to its products. Another trade that lends to this long term thinking is craftsmanship.

[00:14:59] Shree Viswanathan: Now, Hermes invests heavily in training its artisans and preserving traditional craftsmanship techniques. They take a patient approach to production, focusing on quality over speed. Let me tell you something about this lady, Christine Nagel. She’s the head of the perfume division of Hermes. and is termed as the nose of Hermes within the company.

[00:15:24] Shree Viswanathan: Perfumes make up just a few percent of the total business, but I think what, in a recent interview that I read, what she said about her work, her career, and Hermes’s, her employer, is very appropriate in terms of defining this craftsmanship. She created this perfume called H24. This is the first perfume for men in the last 15 plus years.

[00:15:46] Shree Viswanathan: Christine is the first female perfumer for Hermes. She has the gift of what’s called a synesthesia. It’s the merging of certain senses. She says, odors have a color for me. She has the unique ability to smell and taste color. Hermes she says is a playground for me and I’m happy to work for a house with a lot of stories and roots. My day to day life here inspires me because I don’t have the limitation of time or price. And choosing a perfume is not a question of marketing, but if we like the perfume or not. I’m exercising the real job of a real perfumer, we like to go where no one else has or will go.

[00:16:31] Shree Viswanathan: What’s remarkable about Hermes is the constant faith placed in creation and the creator and that’s a very very important phrase to remember all through this. Hermes commitment to the creation and the creator. I’ll come back to that in a few other places later. She says if I was chosen by the house, it was for this signature.

[00:16:52] Shree Viswanathan: This recognition is a source of delight every day because I’m living my dream of creating fragrances that uphold and embody all the values of this house. My only aim, therefore, is to create exceptional fragrances. That’s a little bit about the craftsmanship that I mentioned. This is an integral part of how the company has put together this long term success story.

[00:17:17] Clay Finck: I think there’s so many examples within the company we can think of where they truly think long term. And one that certainly comes to mind that I’d like to mention is during the 1970s, they were going through some issues as a company. And I believe they were speaking with some consultants, these wise consultants were like, Hey, you need to start doing what all these other luxury names are doing, you know, take production elsewhere, minimize costs, increase efficiencies, cut corners on product quality and such.

[00:17:48] Clay Finck: Thankfully, they didn’t go that route. And I believe they even adopted a corporate philosophy of no consultants. They just operate in a much different manner.

[00:17:58] Shree Viswanathan: Yep, absolutely. As you correctly pointed out, this is a unique business and a unique management team in many regards. That’s one of them. I told you that they have this commitment to the creation and the creator.

[00:18:12] Shree Viswanathan: There are many examples in that sense. For example, there was this leather artisan from France who moved to Japan. Primarily, his responsibility in Japan was repair related work, and one day Hermes got a request from the Empress of Japan saying that she wanted one of the bags that she carried that had some sort of strip, a leather strip, she wanted that to be removed, and this gentleman this artisan took a look at the bag and he suggested that they not remove it.

[00:18:45] Shree Viswanathan: If it was removed, it would change the complexion, the quality, and the true value of the bag. So, he did the unthinkable, which is stand up to the impress of Japan. Obviously, this became a big issue, and the current CEO, Axel Dumas father, Jean Louis Dumas was the CEO at that time. It got to him, he intervened, he listened to both sides, and he agreed with the artisan that cutting that strip out would essentially change the nature of the bag.

[00:19:15] Shree Viswanathan: And so he actually had a new bag, without the strips, sent back to the Empress, of course. But it tells you a little bit about how the management team and the culture within the organization is all for the artisan and the creation.

[00:19:29] Clay Finck: So Hermes is well known for being a family owned and family controlled business.

[00:19:35] Clay Finck: They opened up shop in 1837. And as you mentioned, they’ve been operating in that manner for 187 years. I look at Hermes and it just reminds me of one of those companies that doesn’t seem like it should be public, just because it operates much differently than your typical public company. So talk about the family ties and what even led them to being a public company.

[00:19:59] Shree Viswanathan: I mean, in answering your previous question, I listed just a couple of the features, quality and the craftsmanship. But the other important feature is this. A family ownership. This might be, in fact, slightly more important than many other features. Now, it’s a classic family business company. As you said, it’s more than 187 years old.

[00:20:20] Shree Viswanathan: There’s a lot of history and some monumental decision points along the way. Axel Dumas, he’s currently the sixth generation family member, who’s the head of the organization. And from the Dumas family branch is his cousin, Pierre, who is essentially signing off on every product that comes out of the company.

[00:20:41] Shree Viswanathan: So the top two spots are held within the Dumas branch of the family. I’ll come back to that in a second. While there isn’t a precise count of sixth generation family run companies around the world, data suggests that such businesses are quite rare. Now, the odds of a sixth generation family business is 500 to 1.

[00:21:03] Shree Viswanathan: Only 3 percent of the family businesses operate at the fourth generation. 30 percent of businesses get to the second, and only 12 percent get to the third. So, Hermes is currently in ratified air, I would say. But why is that important? You know, there’s a wonderful book called The Founder’s Mentality by Chris Zook and James Allen.

[00:21:26] Shree Viswanathan: I’d say that the founder’s mentality constitutes a key source of competitive advantage, and it consists of three main traits. An insurgent’s mission, owner’s mindset, and an obsession with a front line. They go on to show that the returns to the shareholders from these types of companies is three times higher than in other companies.

[00:21:48] Shree Viswanathan: Back to Hermes, it’s actually controlled by three branches of the founding family. The Dumas family, which I mentioned Axel Dumas is part of that branch. There is the Guérin family, pardon my French actually. As you can tell, I’m originally from India, spent all my life here in the U. S. I have an accent that’s neither European nor American, and so I may be mispronouncing some of these French names.

[00:22:14] Shree Viswanathan: But the second family is the Guerin family, and the third one is the Pouecq family. These three branches are descendants of Émile Maurice Hermès. He was the grandson of the founder of Thierry. Together, these three branches of the family, they currently control 67 percent of Hermes. And this combined ownership is currently worth about 155 billion, making it the world’s third wealthiest family.

[00:22:42] Shree Viswanathan: Al Nahyan family, the family that controls Abu Dhabi, and Walton family from the Walmart wealth, those are the only two that are ahead of this family group. At Hermes, the family itself is one of the secrets and principal assets of the brand’s success. They’re the keepers of the heritage and know how to make it evolve without a revolution.

[00:23:06] Shree Viswanathan: Created in 1837, the company has always been independent. And has been passed down from son to son as it expanded over time from harnesses to saddles to everything that they sell today. Thierry was the founder and his son Charles, he took over the business in 1880. And here’s an interesting stat, he’s the one who moved the company to 24 Faubourg, which is the headquarters even today, more than 150 years later, that is still the headquarters of the company.

[00:23:38] Shree Viswanathan: After Charles Emile, he retired, you know, his two sons Adolph and Emile Morris. They took over, and watching the decline in sales of horse harnesses and saddles, Adolf, he left the business in 1919, letting Emile Morris be the sole owner. That was the glorious period when he introduced many products that are popular even today.

[00:24:00] Shree Viswanathan: For example, Sac de Peche, which is essentially the Kelly bag that we know today. Silk scarves, leather jacket with a zipper. These were all introduced during that period. In the twenties and thirties, he had three daughters, and so Emel Morris is groomed his sons-in-law in the business in 1951, Robert Dumas, he took the helm.

[00:24:25] Shree Viswanathan: He was one of the sons in law. Of course. He’s credited with the success of the Kelly bags, even though they were founded a couple of decades earlier. In 1978, his son, Jean Louis Dumas, he took the helm, and he’s credited with making the Birkin bag, which is even more expensive today. In 2003, for the first time, and the only time, Patrick Thomas, who is not a family member, he took over as the CEO.

[00:24:53] Shree Viswanathan: He ran the company, and he’s the one who successfully defended this hostile takeover attempt from Bernard Arnault of LVMH. And then he handed over the reins to Axel Dumas, who is currently the CEO. As to why Hermes remains public today, Jean Louis Dumas, who was the CEO in the early 90s, when he took the company public, he had a few reasons, apart from providing capital to strengthen its financial position, going public, you know, allowed some of the family members to liquidate their holdings.

[00:25:27] Shree Viswanathan: And Jean Louis said, you know, it helped lessen the family tensions by allowing members to sell some shares without disputes over valuation among themselves. Today, in addition to the family itself owning such a huge percentage, about 80 percent of the employees own some shares of Hermes. So it’s also turned out to be a good compensation tool for the company as artisanship and culture within the organization is all important for the company.

[00:25:57] Shree Viswanathan: So that’s a little bit about the history and why they went public and why they remain public.

[00:26:03] Clay Finck: A hundred fifty five billion in shares owned by the family is amazing to say the least and it’s quite fitting with the show name, We Study Billionaires.

[00:26:13] Shree Viswanathan: Yes, that is perfect.

[00:26:16] Clay Finck: I think it’s a good point to also mention another extremely wealthy billionaire who you just mentioned, Bernard Arnault.

[00:26:22] Clay Finck: Christian Billinger and I chatted about him and LVMH back on episode 645 for listeners that want to learn about that company. You mentioned the attempted takeover. With this being a family business and very high ownership within the family. That really didn’t stop Bernard from that attempt to take over, which ended up being unsuccessful.

[00:26:43] Clay Finck: So I was curious if you could just tell this story because it’s just so fascinating. Just points to sort of Bernard’s character and who Hermes is in that, you know, their family company and they’re not going to let a corporate raider come in and take it away from them.

[00:26:57] Shree Viswanathan: Yeah, this was a momentous episode in the long history of Hermes.

[00:27:01] Shree Viswanathan: You know, just a couple of hours before the world would find out, on October 23rd, 2010, Patrick Thomas, as I mentioned, he was the CEO, he was the person, the only non family member who was the CEO. He was cycling through rural France when he got a call from Bernard Arnault. He took the call standing on the side of the road.

[00:27:23] Shree Viswanathan: Arnault wanted him to know, you know, he was just alerting him that LVMH would be announcing that it had acquired 14. 2 percent stake in Hermes. Hearing this, Patrick, who is enraged, had an immediate and colorful response. Unfortunately, I can’t repeat it here since it’s not appropriate for a family friendly show like this, but your listeners can go Google and find out what exactly was his response.

[00:27:53] Shree Viswanathan: And as the family’s anger and protestation were gathering steam, within less than a week, LVMH announced that it had raised its stake to 17. 1%. The big question in the minds of family and Patrick and everybody was, how did he build such a big stake? Thank you Here’s what we were able to find out between 2001 and 2002.

[00:28:14] Shree Viswanathan: LVMH acquired 4.9% stake through a handful of subsidiaries. French law requires the acquirer to disclose the identity if you go past 5% and if it reaches 10%, the acquirer has to disclose his or her intentions. That’s the reason why LVMH stopped at 4. 9 to hide its identity. LVMH had banks in Luxembourg and Panama purchase shares in Hermes on its behalf.

[00:28:45] Shree Viswanathan: LVMH then paid these banks in cash. In order to avoid any sort of a discovery, nothing happened for about five years. Then the action started again in 2007, when LVMH engaged in a string of complex cash settled equity swaps through financial intermediaries and subsidiaries. However, in 2010, LVMH’s stock swaps with its own subsidiaries.

[00:29:11] Shree Viswanathan: LVMH brought its stake in Hermes to an accumulated 14. 2%, which is what triggered that call. In spite of strong protests from PUAG and Guaran and, you know, Dumas families, LVMH maintained its stake and flatly denied that it was entertaining ambitions to slowly gain control and take over Hermes.

[00:29:34] Shree Viswanathan: While the French regulatory authorities started an investigation into LVMH’s investment, Patrick Thomas said, I’m not a fan of conflict, but I can fight from time to time if necessary. He quietly helped the family set up H51, a private holding company with more than 50 family members who agreed to pool all their shares and to keep them in it for at least 20 years.

[00:30:00] Shree Viswanathan: H51 was designed to have the first right of refusal should a family member decide to sell. LVMH, of course, didn’t back down in spite of this investigation and all those responses from the family. In fact, in May 2011, it announced that its stake had gone up to 21%. And this elicited further response from the family and Patrick.

[00:30:24] Shree Viswanathan: Patrick said this whole affair is ungentlemanly. Hermes culture is fundamentally incompatible with that of a conglomerate such as LVMH. Bertrand Pouet, the head of that Pouet branch of the family, chaHermesn of the company, said, you know, we are the target of incessant attacks of the kind we have never seen in 174 years, even though LVMH says its approach to us is friendly.

[00:30:49] Shree Viswanathan: I don’t agree. With friends like this, who needs enemies? Every time Hermes responded verbally, LVMH upped its stake. By the end of 2011, its stake had gone up to 22. 6%. You know, as you would have suspected by now, there were suits, counted suits, back and forth. And the regulatory authorities were concluding their investigation, and when they did, they ordered LVMH to pay 10.

[00:31:15] Shree Viswanathan: 4 million dollars for serious and successive breaches of public disclosure requirements. LVMH said it would appeal the ruling, and you guessed it, increased its stake further, now to 23. 1%. The two parties were unable to resolve their differences, and court cases continued on for a number of years, for a few years after that.

[00:31:37] Shree Viswanathan: And finally, in 2013, Bernard and LBMH announced that they’ll distribute the stake in Hermes to its shareholders and institutional investors. Even though he had been building up a stake for about nine years, he talked about Hermes for the first time in an earnings call in 2011. Now, Bernard said something very interesting.

[00:31:57] Shree Viswanathan: He said, I understand that they were a bit surprised that we came in, but we ourselves, we didn’t expect to become shareholders of Hermes, and the circumstances meant that starting from a financial investment standpoint, for technical reasons, it was more or less imposed upon us. In the same call, Bernard acknowledged the question about the difference in culture between the two organizations.

[00:32:21] Shree Viswanathan: He said, I’m often told that Hermes culture is different from that of Louis Vuitton. Well, that’s true, but do you prefer Hermes or do you prefer Louis Vuitton? Do you prefer Proust or Stendhal and the two great writers? I think we can prefer one or the other, but we are bound to recognize that both are great talents.

[00:32:42] Shree Viswanathan: I said Christian Dior’s culture is different from that of Chanel’s, which is different from that of Hermes, and that’s different from that of Louis Vuitton’s. I find it rather pointless to oppose cultures. What I believe is that LVMH, in today’s world, is best placed to preserve the crucially important cultures for the future of these companies, and now that we are a significant shareholder of Hermes, we can guarantee the preservation of their culture in the long term.

[00:33:11] Shree Viswanathan: So that’s all about how Bernard and LVMH came at this. But, remembering this event and how they went through, the family finally put another fine touch on this ownership. In 2022, they took a further step to unify this family ownership by bringing eight families together under an investment vehicle called Krefeld Invest.

[00:33:35] Shree Viswanathan: Krefeld is where the founder, Thierry Hermes, was born. So, this will be a family ownership business for a long, long time. Thank you. You’re welcome. This was as I said up front, a very colorful and a momentous episode in the long history of Hermes.

[00:33:50] Clay Finck: What a wonderful story. Just to put some perspective on where shares were when Bernard started buying in around 2001.

[00:33:59] Clay Finck: Shares of Hermes were trading around 50 euros then, and today shares are trading north of 2100, so that’s a over 40 times increase, and of course he doesn’t own that stake anymore today, but yeah, he saw the tremendous value in Hermes, certainly. I want to transition here to talk about their moat. I think it might sound ridiculous to some in the audience to think that a company that sells handbags has a strong moat.

[00:34:26] Clay Finck: I had asked Christian Bellinger, what is it that makes a luxury product different than say, a premium product or a high quality product? And he mentioned the importance of singularity. So the product and the brand are really in a category of their own, and they simply can’t be compared to other products in the minds of consumers.

[00:34:46] Clay Finck: And in preparation for this episode, my friend Leandro, who writes the blog best anchor stocks, he did this wonderful five part writeup on Hermes that I found to be quite helpful, which I’ll be sure to get linked in the show notes. So when looking at Hermes’s competition, one could argue that Hermes and some of the other luxury players are competing for a set amount of luxury dollars, let’s call it.

[00:35:10] Clay Finck: And the way Leandro puts it is that the typical luxury customer rarely has to choose between the product of one company versus another. So if you’re an Hermes customer and you see something that you like at a Brunello Cucinelli, for example, then you likely aren’t going to delay the purchase of a Birkin bag to make that other purchase.

[00:35:31] Clay Finck: And since Hermes is sort of at the top of the luxury industry. This dynamic, I think, plays more into their favor maybe than some of the other players, presumably because they are appealing to the higher end customers. So let’s cover the moat and what gives you confidence in the long term sustainability of the moat.

[00:35:51] Shree Viswanathan: Clay, before I forget, with respect to this Bernard Arnault question. I just want to make one more comment or maybe a couple of more comments. One is Hermes was not the first one that he missed. He tried doing something similar with Gucci before it ended up in what is now known as Kering. And the second comment I want to make is there is a similar effort going on at Richemont today.

[00:36:15] Shree Viswanathan: LVMH has a deep interest in Richemont as well, and there’s likely some change of management team coming up within that company, and he finds Many of those brands are very attractive. I just wanted to mention that before I forgot. Back to your question about the mode of Hermes. Yeah, it’s a wonderful question.

[00:36:34] Shree Viswanathan: Before talking about the mode, I think it’s appropriate to again bring up Kapferer’s book, The Luxury Strategy. I know you discussed that with Christian. Three very important takeaways from that book. One is the 24 anti loss of marketing, which you discussed. Second is that dream equation. Now he explains it very beautifully.

[00:36:56] Shree Viswanathan: He says a basic product corresponds to a need. If you’re thirsty or you need to go to a hospital, the role of the basic product is to do this at the lowest cost. A branded product corresponds to a desire, a wish. Now we are thirsty and we desire a high quality beer, preferably on tap. A luxury product, on the other hand, corresponds to a dream.

[00:37:20] Shree Viswanathan: They do not need to be satisfied. Sometimes their existence alone makes us happy. Luxury brands must be, you know, sensitive to the difference between their level of awareness and their penetration. And he says, in this difference lies the dream. The product is known by all, but bought by a few. So I think that dream equation is another major takeaway from that book.

[00:37:45] Shree Viswanathan: The third one is art and luxury share several characteristics. For example, art value grows over time. How can art achieve this fee? It does so by being totally independent of function. Just as art has done, luxury must decorrelate price and function, according to Kafferer. So those are, I think key takeaways and are worth keeping in mind as we talk about the moat of quality business like Hermès.

[00:38:16] Shree Viswanathan: And I’m sure you’ve heard of this gentleman, François Rochon, who runs Giverny Capital out of Montreal, Canada. He wrote a fabulous newspaper article in 2014 titled, Finding Durability Value is Tough, but it’s Worth the Effort. He says you have to look for three important things in a prospective company.

[00:38:36] Shree Viswanathan: Competitive edge, durability, and culture. I don’t think he had Hermes in mind when he wrote this, but all three are present in plentiful within Hermes. Competitive advantage can be a brand name, reputation for excellence, or a monopoly position. Hermes brand name has not just survived, but thrived over the last 180 plus years.

[00:39:00] Shree Viswanathan: And as for the Lindy effect, it’s likely to last that long. Quality of a product, which I talked about earlier, lends to that reputation. And while companies like LVMH and Chanel offer some similar products, Hermes doesn’t look too much at the competition the case. They fear they might be influenced.

[00:39:20] Shree Viswanathan: Durability, at Hermes, the products are made to last for a really long time. Patrick Thomas, the former CEO, in a recent interview, he talked about an incident where, when he was the CEO of the company, he talked about an incident when a famous actress, he didn’t name her, happened to be a friend, you know, who had a saddle in possession.

[00:39:41] Shree Viswanathan: And she had some issues with the saddle, so when she came in to meet him, brought the saddle and told him about some of the issues that she was facing. He took her to the saddle shop nearby, and the guy, the artisan at the saddle shop, took a look and asked her, you know, when and where did she buy this?

[00:40:01] Shree Viswanathan: And this is a very interesting side note. At their mass, they maintain a log of all the purchases made, essentially a big book of all the purchases made, details of the purchaser, the amount, the item purchased, and if it was repaired, when, where, things like that. So this guy was able to go to the log and see if he could find this actress’s name and the details.

[00:40:25] Shree Viswanathan: He couldn’t find it. And she remembered, no, I got it from my mom. So I said, okay, let’s go look for your mom’s name. And they went and looked for, they couldn’t find it. And she thought, okay, maybe she got it from her mom. And bingo, it was the grandmother who had purchased the saddle more than 70 years, you know, before she came into the office and had never been repaired.

[00:40:47] Shree Viswanathan: Now, that’s durability at its best. So that’s the second feature that Francois Rochon, for example, writes about in that article. And the culture. You can appreciate the culture within the organization, not just from the family standpoint, but from the 23, 000 employees as well, particularly the artisans.

[00:41:04] Shree Viswanathan: As I mentioned, the commitment to the creator and the creation has developed a very unique culture within the organization. I already mentioned this diplomatic quandary that they found themselves in when this gentleman, Francis Norbert, From France, he went to Japan and stood up to the Empress. And all three factors are sustainable over a really long term.

[00:41:28] Shree Viswanathan: And these are the sort of features that combine to form what is called as the moat within the organization.

[00:41:36] Clay Finck: There’s a couple points I’d like to hit on there. So I pulled a quote from Axel Dumas from the 2022 AGM that ties in well with your comments. He said that performance is important, but resilience is of paramount importance.

[00:41:51] Clay Finck: I wanted to also mention the Birkin and Kelly bags because the high desirability of these products are extremely important and getting these bags is not easy. You and I just can’t walk in and just pick one up off the shelves. It’s a process and I’ll give you the opportunity to share a bit about that if you’d like.

[00:42:09] Clay Finck: So to give the audience a sense of the prices of these bags and sort of their history, the Kelly typically retails for somewhere around 7, 000 and then the Birkin bag, it’s a bit more expensive at 10, 000. And one thing I found just extremely fascinating with this is you’re talking about the durability and the resilience of the brand.

[00:42:30] Clay Finck: These two bags have had a compounded annual growth rate of 4 percent in their price over the past 50 years. What’s also very interesting and pointing to the desirability of these bags Is that oftentimes customers can buy these from Hermes and they can sell them tomorrow in the off market for more than what they bought it for.

[00:42:51] Clay Finck: Just like it goes completely counter to what we learned about business and it just points to, there’s a lot of untapped pricing power with these bags and that’s likely to be sustained for a very long period of time. Who knows how long it seems quite durable.

[00:43:09] Shree Viswanathan: Absolutely, absolutely. Yeah, those prices that you mentioned, you know, there are actually 17 different bags, at least that I am aware of, that the company makes.

[00:43:20] Shree Viswanathan: Birkin and Kelly are the two famous ones. Close to those two are the third brand, which is Constance. There are many other brands of bags that they manufacture. The 10,000 for a Birkin is at the lowest end. The price of the bag depends upon the complexity involved, the skin type, the quality of the leather.

[00:43:41] Shree Viswanathan: For example, the crocodile skin is one of the most expensive, and they have something called the Himalayan crocodile skin color. Himalayan is not necessarily to do with the mountain, but it’s more the color white with a blend of gray in it. For when you see it in picture, you’ll see what I’m talking about.

[00:44:01] Shree Viswanathan: But those things go for hundreds of thousands of dollars. That’s just retail, and you are right. These bags are not necessarily available for us to walk into a store and buy it on the spot. Typically, this is again, part of the culture within the organization. Part of managing the brand, managing the supply, and everything associated with making sure they put out the best quality product that lasts for a long time.

[00:44:30] Shree Viswanathan: And so to begin with, these bags, which are made by these artisans. It takes a long time. So, for example, an average mass market automobile can be put together within somewhere between 18 to 35 hours. It takes about 40 hours to make just one bag, one Birkin bag. It takes about 20 plus hours for Kelly, which is apparently a little less complicated.

[00:45:00] Shree Viswanathan: But still, it gives you some context. And the other interesting and an important feature here is, Hermes has a requirement that the artisan who makes the first cut on the leather gets to essentially complete the bag. So it’s one artisan working on one bag. That’s the reason why it takes about 40 hours.

[00:45:20] Shree Viswanathan: And by the time the artisan gets to make the first cut of this very expensive leather, the artisan has gone through some serious training. The company hires about 200 artisans a year, and they go through mandatory schooling for about a couple of years. And even after that, it takes about six years for them to work with a veteran and another couple of years after that before they can graduate to making the first cut for a Birkin or Kelly.

[00:45:51] Shree Viswanathan: So it takes a really long time. In the meantime, as I described, the veteran who is well trained is also not necessarily focused on making The product every day, because he or she is now having to spend time with these novices who are growing within the organization. So the culture and the commitment to quality comes from a variety of different angles.

[00:46:15] Shree Viswanathan: And so the margins on these products are immense. While they don’t necessarily disclose what the cost is on a per bag basis, if you look at the gross margin of this business, you may think that it’s more like a software company at 70 percent consistently over time. It’s partly because of the pricing that they’re able to obtain on these really high quality products.

[00:46:41] Shree Viswanathan: Back to your point about pricing and the ability to walk into a store and buy these things. Yeah, that’s not possible because there is significant demand for these products. And at the same time, they have serious constraint in how many bags they can actually put out. Unofficially, I’ve seen numbers, something like 12, 000 Birkin bags a year.

[00:47:01] Shree Viswanathan: For a company that’s about 240 billion in euros in market cap. 12,000 bags a year, and each bag taking about 40 hours. That’s partly self constrained, and at the same time, that commitment. So that all translates into a really healthy margin, and net margin, in fact, has continued to go up. Post COVID, net margin has also gone up quite significantly.

[00:47:24] Shree Viswanathan: These bags are not readily available, even though the company has in fact, the fastest growing segment within the company is online. You can buy many products within, you know, from the online stores, but you can’t buy these two bags or a few other bags that they manufacture through the online option.

[00:47:43] Shree Viswanathan: As a result, you know, the company maintains sort of a wait list. It’s an unofficial wait list. You are not required to put a deposit down. You’re required to put your name and contact info down as and when that particular salesman or the representative at the store finds it available and interesting enough, picks up the phone and calls you and if you are ready, you go by.

[00:48:07] Shree Viswanathan: If not, they go to the next guy on the wait list and these wait lists go from anywhere from one year to six years. It moves around a little bit and that, again, lends to the stable top line over time. In fact, both Hermes and LVMH were the two companies that had positive revenue numbers even during the financial crisis.

[00:48:29] Shree Viswanathan: Now, the numbers did go down. They were down about 7 plus percent in Hermes during COVID, partly because most of the stores around the world were shut down. But the fact that even during the great financial crisis. The company was able to put out positive revenue numbers, tells you a little bit about how this wait list helps them remain committed to quality and continue to put out strong top line.

[00:48:54] Clay Finck: One comment I have in relation to the Birkin and Kelly bags, they almost require customers to spend something like three times the amount in the store on other items before they get the call and say, hey, we have a Birkin or Kelly ready for you. And they don’t even get to pick the color of the bag.

[00:49:10] Clay Finck: They’re going to get something about it almost doesn’t feel right. And it makes me think of the luxury strategy, the anti law of marketing that mentioned to dominate the client. I mean, that’s what dominating the client looks like. That brings a question of why aren’t some of these customers just going out and purchasing the exact bag they want from just somebody else and not going directly to the store?

[00:49:31] Clay Finck: I’m curious your thoughts on that.

[00:49:33] Shree Viswanathan: Yeah, I think that’s a wonderful question. In fact, there is actually a case going on, a couple of purchasers from California filed a suit alleging that there is something called this tying, which is you get to buy the bag only if you buy a few other items. I’m not sure how this is going to settle, but it is a live case that you bring up at this point.

[00:49:55] Shree Viswanathan: It’s tied to this question about why aren’t customers willing to go buy other products. Well, that tells you a lot about the quality of something like a Birkin or a Kelly. There are no alternatives. There are really no alternatives for something like a Birkin or a Kelly. If it was available, yes. Many of these buyers would gladly go buy you know, those alternatives.

[00:50:19] Shree Viswanathan: Yeah, Chanel puts out good quality bags, but it’s not a Birkin. Louis Vuitton puts out good quality bags, but it’s not a Birkin. So, there is something about a qualitative feature of this name Birkin or the name Kelly that brings credibility to these bags that is absent in many of them. With some of the buyers, it may not matter.

[00:50:40] Shree Viswanathan: But many actually crave, would actually wait for a few years to get their hands on these types of bags. Peter Bernstein in 1956, he wrote a very interesting article on Harvard Business Review. He talked about growth companies, provided essentially a checklist of growth companies, and he listed a number of items.

[00:51:03] Shree Viswanathan: A few of them are relevant to this point that you are raising. One of them is the ability to create its own market is the strategic, dominating, and the single most distinguishing characteristic of a true growth company. The company’s products have above average profit margins. The products have little to no price competition.

[00:51:24] Shree Viswanathan: The company is constantly improving products, developing new products, or creating new markets for existing products, which help insulate it from economic trends. It’s a non conformist and economic society. It adapts the outside world to itself by creating something or a demand for something which did not exist before, instead of adapting itself to the changes in the outside world.

[00:51:48] Shree Viswanathan: So he lists a number of these things, and I’m sure he did not have Hermes or luxury for that matter in mind when he wrote this, but this was 1956, and he answers your exact same question.

[00:52:01] Clay Finck: So given that the moat is just so strong and that the family is so incredibly protective of the brand, they really have a lot of control on how fast they can grow to a large extent because they set their own prices.

[00:52:14] Clay Finck: And it’s also worth mentioning that like Axel Dumas mentioned that they’re producing as many of these bags as they can, and they’re not purposely limiting supply like a lot of people would think with a lot of these luxury names, just artificially suppressing it. So I’m curious about their future growth.

[00:52:30] Clay Finck: Obviously they’re a very large company today. Their market capitalization is 222 billion euros. So a very big company already today. I’m curious your thoughts on what you’re looking at for growth for say the next three or five years. And I think another important point of this company is Just that untapped pricing power we discussed and that pricing power is going to be used and implemented for many, many years down the line that’s going to impact your terminal value when looking at this company, which, you know, it’s a much different terminal value for a company like this than I think for a lot of other companies.

[00:53:08] Clay Finck: So that’s also an essential part. So maybe you could speak to that terminal value in the longer term growth.

[00:53:13] Shree Viswanathan: Altagama is an Italian trade association that includes mostly Italian and some European brands. Altagama and Bain Capital, Bain Consulting rather, they released a report on the luxury market in I think it was 2022.

[00:53:29] Shree Viswanathan: And a couple of years prior to that, Deloitte had also released a similar study and Sanford Bernstein’s analyst Luca has released some studies on this luxury market. All of them point to a market that’s about personal luxury product market is about 350 billion and is growing at a high single digit percentage.

[00:53:50] Shree Viswanathan: Luxury market consumer base is expected to grow from 400 million in 2022 to 500 million by 2030, just about eight years. Already crossed a couple of years into that. The size of the market is expected to go from 350 billion euros to somewhere between 540 to 580 billion. That’s about a 50 percent growth.

[00:54:13] Shree Viswanathan: Among these rising stars, one of the countries that they highlight is India. You know, India stands out. Its luxury market is currently approximately 50 billion euros, is expected to hit 200 billion by 2030. You know, more than three times where it is today. If you look specifically at Hermes, as you would suspect, sales has grown at a much better rate than what the market has done so far.

[00:54:40] Shree Viswanathan: As I said, revenues did go down a little bit during COVID, but revenue growth over the last five years has been approximately 19%. More than offsets the small decline in 2020. Revenue growth over the last 10 and 20 years being 14 and 13%. Now it’s a remarkably resilient business. And as I mentioned earlier, this is one of the few businesses that actually had revenue go up about eight and a half percent in 2008 during the crisis, during the financial crisis.

[00:55:10] Shree Viswanathan: As for the next few years, I expect a similar low 10 percent revenue growth. Your question, you mentioned that the company has the ability to control its growth. I think that’s a very unique feature in this retail business. In some manufacturing businesses, for example, you know, the customer puts down a deposit while placing an order, which then leads to a negative working capital situation, which is wonderful.

[00:55:36] Shree Viswanathan: But here, it’s a retail business where the customer is scrambling to get on a wait list that runs anywhere from one to six years. Apart from being able to control its growth, another aspect to take into account is the considerable operating leverage. Now, given the business. Where the company controls it’s vertically integrated in a business model, it’s fixed costs are high, at least relative to many other players in the ecosystem.

[00:56:04] Shree Viswanathan: In 2024, for example, you know, they instituted an 8 to 9 percent price increase. That’s at the company level, individual geographies. We’ll have had different percentages, for example, Japan, whose currency has been depreciating at a rapid clip, notwithstanding what happened in early August, is expected to see a double digit price increase.

[00:56:28] Shree Viswanathan: So that 8 to 9 percent for 2024 is at the company level. That is essentially remaining true to covering its production costs. Production costs have increased at approximately 6%. The price increase that the Institute also goes towards pointing out the commitment to the employees. Axel Dumas, he said, we wanted to cover the currency impact.

[00:56:52] Shree Viswanathan: That’s quite negative. And that’s an extra cost of about 300 million euros. This is in 2024. So the price increase that the Institute takes into account, the increase in raw material cost. Labor costs and this foreign exchange in certain situations like Japan, all that is taken into account and they push through somewhere in the 5 to 10 percent consistently, but more recently they’ve done 8 to 9 percent.

[00:57:20] Shree Viswanathan: Typically when you push through that sort of a price increase regularly, you may feel pushback from your customers. It’s the exact opposite in a company like Hermes and many luxury companies as well, but particularly in Hermes. And that’s likely to continue. That’s likely to continue for a variety of reasons.

[00:57:39] Shree Viswanathan: The brand strength, the increasing demand from not just the existing marketplaces, but also countries like India and Southeastern Asia, African countries. And so in my estimation, I still expect a low team percent revenue growth after taking into account these types of price increases.

[00:58:01] Clay Finck: Do you have any thoughts on terminal value since that seems to just be such an important aspect of Hermes, say 10 years down the line, you would expect the growth to be higher than say the GDP growth rate, for example.

[00:58:15] Shree Viswanathan: Absolutely. Yeah. Again, luxury as a business is one where it’s grown at almost two times. The GDP growth rate beginning in the mid 90s, of course, a big reason is the growth in China over the last 15 20 years, but the business has continued to grow at a much better rate than GDP. As for your question about terminal value, yeah, that is absolutely key.

[00:58:40] Shree Viswanathan: You know, if you extend it, say, over the next five years, your cash flow model based on, let’s say, the next five years, irrespective of whatever timeline you use. Anywhere from 85 to 90 some percent of the eventual value lies in this terminal value. That is based on the kind of margins, the kind of cash flow that the business generates, and the quality aspects that we have discussed all through the call today.

[00:59:06] Shree Viswanathan: So, I’ve run a variety of scenarios in my analysis. Every single time, I arrive at a terminal value that’s well north of mid 80%. You know, that tells you a lot about the definition quality as it relates to Hermes.

[00:59:22] Clay Finck: Yeah. And just to make sure I’m understanding it correctly. So north of 80 percent lies in the terminal value.

[00:59:29] Clay Finck: And that’s relative to what you determine as your intrinsic value. So I also want to discuss capital allocation and valuation. So Christian Billinger actually chatted with our TIP mastermind community. He talked through the financial statements and all these metrics on Hermes and LVMH. And one of the things he mentioned that just really blew my mind is he mentioned that Hermes is return on incremental invested capital is north of 100%.

[00:59:58] Clay Finck: It’s just an amazing metric and it helps further illustrate just the quality of this business. So when they’re renovating their stores or maybe building a new store or investing in R and D and such, they’re getting a high, high return on that investment. But the problem is they can’t reinvest a hundred percent of their cash flows. So it’s just a portion of it. So talk about how they approach capital allocation.

[01:00:22] Shree Viswanathan: You know, when you look at any business, when you go from the top of the income statement down, as you hit the gross margin line item, you can tell by looking at the gross margin, the consistency of the gross margin line item, you can tell what the quality of the business is.

[01:00:39] Shree Viswanathan: To understand the quality of the management team, you can go from the bottom of the income statement up. And in both cases, in the case of Zermes, you can tell the quality of the business, you know, 70 plus percent gross margin, the healthy net margin tells you a lot about the quality of the management team as well.

[01:00:58] Shree Viswanathan: That all leads to this prodigious cash machine that we’re discussing today, which is Zermes. On a free cash flow basis, on a per share basis, free cash flow per share in, for example, 2023 was about 34 euros per share. Which is almost five times what it was 10 years ago. So that free cash flow is a number that continues to grow at a very healthy double digit rate.

[01:01:24] Shree Viswanathan: And I expect, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, I expect that to continue to perform at a high level. What does the management team do with the prodigious cash? In fact, Axel Dumas addressed this in 2018. In his prepared remarks, he said, we keep one third of the cash for dividends. This is for the following year.

[01:01:45] Shree Viswanathan: And that includes special dividend, for example, in 2023, they just announced a special dividend of 10 euros per share on top of the regular, one third for capex for the following year, and another third for the future. And that I think he was referring to as capex for the future. Unlike LVMH, Hermes doesn’t do any acquisitions.

[01:02:08] Shree Viswanathan: They’ve done a few, very few in the past, but that’s not the mojo here. It’s organic growth and reinvestment through what are called ateliers, these workshops. They’ve got 54 of them in France today. Along with the year end earnings announcement, they said they want to open up four more early years over the next four years, one each year.

[01:02:32] Shree Viswanathan: And so these things take up a lot of capital. And as I mentioned, Chicago’s store, for example, was refurbished a couple of years ago. I haven’t been to the new store. So that sort of a refurbishment is an ongoing exercise across the world. They did one in Vegas. They’ve done one in Beijing, for example. And so that refurbishment, and of course, they open up new stores.

[01:02:54] Shree Viswanathan: So all these things take up capital over a long stretch of time. They also have a small buyback program in place. I think 10 percent is something that they can buy back. They have done a little bit of buyback, but that’s not their primary capital return. As we discussed earlier, this is essentially a family run business.

[01:03:14] Shree Viswanathan: Almost 70%, 67 percent is in the hands of those family members, 50 plus family members are a part of this. As a part of keeping the group together without a revolution, it’s part of their strategy to pay a healthy dividend. So unlike LVMH or maybe a few other, even non-luxury businesses, where we may see very efficient capital management, you can probably point out a few inefficiencies.

[01:03:42] Shree Viswanathan: Of course, the management team wouldn’t accept them as inefficiencies. It’s part of the strategy. It’s part of their culture, keeping their artisans together. In fact, they also have a free share compensation program to the artisans. In addition to these things, as a part of the culture of keeping the artisans happy, they get more than 12 paychecks per year.

[01:04:05] Shree Viswanathan: Depending upon the year, there is one extra paycheck for seniority, a few other paychecks for the company doing well over a stretch of time. So, those all come into play as a part of what we may define as inefficient capital management. But that’s part of the culture. Bringing it back, yeah, they currently sit on what appear to be a hefty cash balance, approximately nine and a half or close to 10 billion net cash on the balance sheet.

[01:04:33] Shree Viswanathan: But that’s by design again. They want to remain independent, be able to fund their growth internally through their own funds. Keep the family unit, the group together without a revolution. And so that’s how they’ve thought about capital management. It prioritizes the capital allocation strategy, prioritizes long term value creation and brand strengthening over short term profitability or aggressive expansion.

[01:05:03] Clay Finck: So, Howard Marks and Morgan Housel recently recorded a podcast together. They discussed the impact of debt and the podcast was just phenomenal. One of the points that Howard made is when you go back and you look at bankruptcies during these various financial crises, excessive debt is involved in every single one.

[01:05:24] Clay Finck: debt works well until the unimaginable happens. And when you’re focused on maximizing the terminal value, it’s not just critical to be able to withstand the average crisis. It’s critical to withstand every crisis. So I think your typical investor would look at 10 billion euros on the balance sheet. I mean, that’s just insane, but it’s not insane if you’re Hermes, because you’re maximizing for the terminal value and you care about that durability.

[01:05:52] Clay Finck: And that terminal value. So add a note here that conventional wisdom tells us that a lot of this cash should be distributed through dividends or through share buybacks, but air messes, anything but a conventional company. All right. So I’m sure a lot of people when they clicked play on this episode, they know Hermes is an amazing company, but it’s probably too expensive in their eyes.

[01:06:15] Clay Finck: So the PE multiple today sits around 50 and we’re recording here on August 29th, 2024. And the share price on the ticker RMS on the Paris stock exchange is around 2160 euros. So I’ll just throw it back over to you to talk about valuation.

[01:06:33] Shree Viswanathan: Ah, yes, the premium valuation of Hermes relative to the market or even to the luxury landscape.

[01:06:40] Shree Viswanathan: At the outset, you know, one explanation for this valuation is the markets expect Hermes to continue to maintain its healthy profitability while growing at this fast pace. That’s been the case for a long time. If you actually go back to 1990, mid 90s, if you look at the P multiple, average has been somewhere close to where it’s trading today.

[01:07:02] Shree Viswanathan: Maybe slightly less, but not a whole lot different from where it’s trading today. While that may not be satisfying for the valuation minded investor, let me offer a couple of thought leaders. Who have helped me think about quality and long term, you know, one that I would bring to this point is one, Mr. Bharat Shah is the head of research at a firm called ASK funds in India. He wrote a fabulous book long time back called off long term value and wealth creation. As you know, I started investing in India, I was in India recently and met with him. He talks about quality and valuation associated with quality very elegantly.

[01:07:44] Shree Viswanathan: He didn’t talk about Hermes, but I’m just highlighting his perspective on quality and how I view Hermes’s valuation today. Typically, returns on stocks reflect the underlying business’s earnings growth. Right? When earnings have compounded at X percent, returns on the stock are generally around X. When the stock returns X plus Y percent, that Y is the result of quality.

[01:08:10] Shree Viswanathan: Obviously, this should be evaluated over a long stretch of time. Now, in the case of Hermes, earnings have gone up around five times over the last ten years. The stock has gone up about seven times over that ten year period. Over the last 20 years, earnings have gone up 21 times, and the stock has gone up almost 50 times.

[01:08:31] Shree Viswanathan: Back to Bharat, you know, he says quality is more real than the numbers like growth or whatever else that we can compute. Because it can be computed, it sounds mathematical. What is mathematical sounds precise and what is precise sounds true. While all of that may have some merit, quality simply because it’s not so easy to compute or to define very pinpointed manner, it doesn’t mean that it doesn’t exist.

[01:09:02] Shree Viswanathan: It’s just that we need to learn to better appreciate the market mechanism and valuation mechanism really works in the market. That’s essentially the essence of what Bharat has taught me or what I have learned from him through his view of quality. And that’s what I would bring to bear in the case of Vermes evaluation today.

[01:09:22] Shree Viswanathan: Of course, we can’t run around assigning, you know, super high multiple to all businesses and claim that they’re quality. And that’s where I would bring in, for example, Peter Bernstein’s. 1956 article in HBR to bear when you bring all that to account, you know, you’ve got a business that is almost that doesn’t have any competition.

[01:09:45] Shree Viswanathan: Has complete control over its growth as control over its pricing power. has a strong brand loyalty. When you bring all that together and you bring Bharat’s view of quality and how it translates into valuation, current valuation, I would say is fair. It’s probably not cheap, but I don’t think it is supremely rich.

[01:10:09] Shree Viswanathan: It’s just fair, and the historical performance tells you a lot about why one should at least take a view at what Bharat is saying and what Peter Bernstein has written about. That’s how I view valuation today, and that’s why it’s part of my portfolio.

[01:10:27] Clay Finck: Oftentimes the toughest part of some of these quality companies is figuring out the right valuation.

[01:10:33] Clay Finck: I looked back over the past five years and there’s been three scenarios where the market sold off this stock by 20 percent or more. I think that’s one other thing about the company is the drawdowns. I think the volatility relative to the market tends to be lower based on what I’ve seen. I think the pricing power is also worth revisiting.

[01:10:53] Clay Finck: You mentioned the recent price hikes that were above average, but I think over time their price increases have actually been pretty modest. So do you know what price increases look like say over the next three to five years? Or does management give a sense on what that might look like?

[01:11:12] Shree Viswanathan: They don’t talk about the future in those terms, but you can absolutely look back and see what they have done and why they have incorporated those price increases.

[01:11:22] Shree Viswanathan: That’s how I arrive at this. It’s somewhere in the high single digit percentages price increase. Of course, in the case of 2024, Axel Dumas in the earnings call did say they were instituting eight to nine percent price increase, but it’s generally in the high single digit percent at the company level, and different geographies may have different price increases.

[01:11:45] Shree Viswanathan: That’s been a consistent theme. In fact, going back to the book about luxury by Kapferer, one of the things he talks about is a luxury company must institute price increase irrespective of what the underlying economy does. And in fact, do not have a price based or a discount based sale program. If you walk into a store and you end up buying, eventually buying, say 30, 000 worth of Birkin bag, and for that exact same bag, I go in and buy a 20, 000, how would you feel if I told you that?

[01:12:20] Shree Viswanathan: So, in luxury, discount to pricing is never The right strategy. Most of them do not do it. But instituting this price increase is somewhere in the, I would say, high single digit percent and that’s been consistent. It’s essentially, Axel Dumas, he talked about this. It was his mom in the 1980s who came up with a strategy of having this price increase at a percent higher than the cost.

[01:12:45] Shree Viswanathan: In this case, cost increase was around 6 percent and they’re pushing through a few percent more than the cost. That’s how they end up in this high single digit percent. So that’s been consistent for a long time. I expect them to continue to do that in the next three, five years and far into the future.

[01:13:05] Clay Finck: Yeah, and some other points on valuation I think are also worth noting is that the market tends to put a premium on certainty. So if there’s a high level of certainty that free cash flows are going to continue to grow and revenues are going to continue to grow and it’s a good inflation hedge, they can increase their prices in line, at least with inflation.

[01:13:23] Clay Finck: And I believe you mentioned earlier that it was LVMH and Hermes that have been growing in China. And I think on our previous call, you mentioned to me that Hermes is going to be able to grow in essentially any economic environment. One, due to the quality, but two, just due to the luxury market overall, the growth being quite strong globally.

[01:13:43] Clay Finck: Yeah, so maybe there’s more to add on China, because China’s around half of Hermes’s business. And I think it’s really amazing to hear that Hermes is still growing in China and in Asia, despite these economic issues they’re currently going through.

[01:13:59] Shree Viswanathan: Absolutely. Absolutely. Before I forget, we brought up a very interesting point about inflation.

[01:14:05] Shree Viswanathan: I don’t know who ran this study, but somebody did, and they actually compared the price of gold, the price of S&P 500, the index, and the price of Birkin bag. As you may guess, over a long stretch, I think about 25 years or so, S&P, of course, beat out gold, hands down, but the price of Birkin actually beat out S&P itself.

[01:14:28] Clay Finck: It’s honestly unbelievable.

[01:14:30] Shree Viswanathan: Yeah, and so this person was essentially pointing out how Birkin could be a better inflation hedge than many things that we generally consider as inflation hedge. That’s for you to chew on later, but back to your question about China. Many luxury brands have benefited from this, enormously benefited from this growth of China.

[01:14:53] Shree Viswanathan: I mentioned luxury as a sector has grown at two times the global GDP since the mid 90s. Much of it is due to the growth of China. And today, both LVMH and Hermes, for example, have a little less than 50 percent of their business coming from Asia X Japan, which is essentially China. Japan, by the way, is another big market, has been a big market for luxury for a long time.

[01:15:20] Shree Viswanathan: And as I mentioned, that gentleman, Francois, he moved to Japan because the Japanese market was growing back in the 70s. The other interesting aspect, this is not just China. The other interesting aspect about Hermes is when they operate these stores. What they maintain in each store is essentially catering to the local clientele.

[01:15:43] Shree Viswanathan: There are many luxury companies that cater to the tourist community. Chinese are known to spend enormously on their when they travel. And so many luxury brands and premium and super premium brands have geared up their businesses to cater to that touring Chinese community. But for example, in the case of Hermes.

[01:16:03] Shree Viswanathan: What you may find in a Hermes Beverly Hills store would be different from what you would see in Boston. And that’s because the store manager, the director, is buying products from the company that cater to the local community. And that’s another distinct feature I want to highlight here. Twice a year, every six months, The store director, approximately 300 stores, 295 to be precise, but 300 stores, all these directors go to Paris twice a year, and they buy products that they think, or they essentially get products from the headquarters that they think will sell well in their store.

[01:16:45] Shree Viswanathan: And that’s the reason why products in different stores may look different. Of course, there are going to be similarities like some of these handbags and a few other products that they sell, but the scarves, for example, that you find in Beijing may be different from what you find in Bombay or Mumbai. So, that’s another distinct feature.

[01:17:04] Shree Viswanathan: Catering to the local community as opposed to the tourist community. Is an important feature that has helped the company come through different cycles. And today in the most recent quarter, also announced that along with many other luxury brands that their sales in China was a little soft. Chinese buyers have historically this was actually who mentioned this.

[01:17:27] Shree Viswanathan: He said, chinese buyers have historically relied on their local real estate and their stock market, which has been the support for their wealth to be able to spend on luxury products. As you very well know, both asset classes have been hurt badly in China. And that’s one of the reasons why the luxury market has had this.

[01:17:48] Shree Viswanathan: soft patch. Be that as it may, they still have a very robust presence in China, 30 some stores, the second highest number of stores around the world, you know, 40 something in the U.S., 30 something in China, and I think 22 or 23 in France. They still have a big presence there and they expect the Chinese buyer to be able to come back and, you know, buy our best products over time.

[01:18:12] Shree Viswanathan: But in the meantime, they’re not necessarily just waiting for the Chinese buyer to come back. Within Asia, for example, as I mentioned earlier, India is a big market for them. The Indian luxury market itself is expected to grow three times. In my most recent trip, for example, I was in Mumbai. I was going through, going in an Uber to one of my meetings, going through the largest slum in the world.

[01:18:38] Shree Viswanathan: This is the slum where part of the movie Slumdog Millionaire was shot. Going in the opposite direction to me was a Rolls Royce. This is a very common scene in India. This is a country with contradictions galore. I come from a city down south, a city called Chennai, used to be called as Madras.

[01:18:58] Shree Viswanathan: Madras. Supposedly a conservative city. Right close to the airport is a Rolls Royce dealership. I was very surprised. This is to just highlight the fact that India as a luxury market maybe is at a very incipient stage, but is absolutely bound to grow. That’s just one of the markets. Africa is growing through similar growth pattern.

[01:19:22] Shree Viswanathan: Much of Indonesia, Vietnam, a few other Southeast Asian countries are also growing at a reasonably good clip. And that’s partly why I keep saying I have a growth expectation that’s slightly better than inconsistent numbers relative to what they’ve done in the past. Definitely better than many other luxury markets.

[01:19:43] Shree Viswanathan: So yeah, China is a big market as is going through a relatively soft patch company and a few of its competitors do expect. The Chinese market to come back may take a little longer than expected, but we’ll come back. In the meantime, many other peripheral markets are opening up at a healthy pace.

[01:20:03] Clay Finck: One more question on China and India, so 295 stores today globally, do you have an idea of what the store counts look like in India and China and if they’ll be pursuing opening new stores in those markets in the coming years?

[01:20:21] Shree Viswanathan: Absolutely. So they currently have 36 stores, I think, in China, but only three in India, only three. The third one was just opened recently, but in both markets, they expect the number of stores to go up. I mentioned anecdotally from my own experience as to where I see luxury in India. And I left the country a long time ago, and it was an absolutely poor, it still is poor, but it was an absolutely poor and socialist country, has come a long way, is positioned exceptionally well, is evident in many of the market dynamics that we are seeing today.

[01:20:58] Shree Viswanathan: That’s just India. China, over the last 30 plus years, has had a phenomenal growth. No time in history have we seen so many hundreds of millions of people get upgraded from penury and poverty to middle income and upper class. As I mentioned, they just expect this soft market to play out over the next few years.

[01:21:17] Shree Viswanathan: They’re still growing their store base within the country. I’m not sure what the plans are in terms of specific numbers for both countries. And that’s something that they don’t disclose publicly. What they have disclosed is the ateliers, the workshops, and they are talking about just four workshops over the next four years.

[01:21:36] Shree Viswanathan: But the number of stores in both countries are expected to grow. I suspect the number of stores in India will be growing. The number of new stores in India will be more than number of new stores in China. I think that’s a reasonable conclusion to make.

[01:21:51] Clay Finck: Wonderful. It’s really fun to talk about all the good things in a company like Hermes, but I think I can come up with plenty of reasons why things might go wrong or things might not go as planned.

[01:22:04] Clay Finck: Just to mention a couple here, let’s say younger generations aren’t as interested in high end luxury. Or maybe the growth in India doesn’t go as planned, or the Chinese economy continue on its downward trajectory, or maybe it takes a while to recover. Yeah, I’m interested in hearing what you think are some of the biggest risks that you’d be monitoring as an investor in this company.

[01:22:28] Shree Viswanathan: So, in a company that is more than 180 years old, you would suspect that it’s gone through some existential questions. And of course it has. As I mentioned, Adolf, one of the brothers of Emile Morris, left the business in 1919 because there was a significant slowdown in the sales of horse harnesses and saddles because automobiles were sprouting up all over the country, all over the world.

[01:22:55] Shree Viswanathan: Of course, Emile Morris started supplying to both the automobile market and some of the nobility that existed at that time. That’s just one example of how the company had an existential question raised, and it has come through very successfully. It’s also had the factor of luck work in its favor. For example, even though the bag itself was released to the market in the 1920s, Kelly, as a bag, did not become as popular until Grace Kelly, the Princess of Monaco, a Hollywood actress, was essentially hid her pregnant belly using the bag. And Birkin bag itself was also an accident that turned out to be a big success. Jean Louis Dumas, he was sitting right next to this actress Jane Birkin, and she spilled a whole bunch of things from her bag and complained about not having a good bag to keep all her things, including her kids things, in a big enough bag.

[01:23:54] Shree Viswanathan: And that’s how the Birkin was founded. So while the company has had existential questions raised, it’s had some lucky breaks, it came through this Bernard Arnault assault successfully, and I’m sure it’ll go through some existential question in the future. I’m absolutely not discounting it. However, I am confident that having come through these tough situations, it has the experience, the expertise, the management team, and the financial wherewithal to withstand any kind of assault.

[01:24:30] Shree Viswanathan: One of the quirky things about this company is, there are many quirky things, but one of the quirky things about this company is they put out an annual report that runs to almost 600 pages. 2023 annual report is about 592 or 93 pages. European companies generally cover many things ESG related and all that, which makes the annual report even longer than American ones, but this is one of the longest that I have come across.

[01:24:59] Shree Viswanathan: It is so long that they actually have a sort of bibliography or a sort of a cross reference table in the end. Where you can search by words or phrases and go to the actual page number. But in any case, in the middle of the annual report, about 380 or 384 page number, they have a nice table about risk factors, certain risk factors that they view, and the severity of the risk factors on one axis, and the variety of risk factors on the other.

[01:25:29] Shree Viswanathan: As you very nicely said, listening to Howard Marks podcast, debt is a killer in many businesses. We don’t have that problem here, right? It’s a net cash balance sheet, has been a net cash balance sheet for a long time. Ownership interest, it’s held within this family and now they have this other investment vehicle called Krefeld Invest, which makes it even more difficult to pry open the family ownership.

[01:25:56] Shree Viswanathan: Those things are not going to be a problem, but if you go back to this table, one factor that they list, and which I agree with, is the reputational risk. Just a few years ago, 2020 or 21, there was a video circulated which showed in a crocodile farm in Australia, the treatment meted out to these crocodiles.

[01:26:19] Shree Viswanathan: It was very inhuman. It was very unfriendly. People immediately concluded that it was Hermes controlled crocodile form. Hermes, by the way, it controls its suppliers. Crocodile skin being an important quality feature on a working bag. They do control crocodile farms in Australia. But it was a video that was distributed and got wide attention.

[01:26:44] Shree Viswanathan: In fact, Jane Birkin, before she passed away, she actually announced that she may actually dissociate her name from the company because she was so perturbed by this mistreatment. Later on, they found out that this whole footage was from a farm that somebody else had. It was not a Hermes form, but the damage was done.

[01:27:06] Shree Viswanathan: That sort of a reputational risk is what I worry about the most. By the way, to address this leather and various different skins, One of the areas where the company is spending capital on is something called mycelium. Mycelium is essentially the roots of a mushroom. Apparently when you put a whole bunch of roots of the mushroom together, it gets into a material that is close enough to leather.

[01:27:33] Shree Viswanathan: And so they’re working on making their products even more eco friendly. I’m not sure when they will come out with mushroom leather, but to avoid these types of reputational risks. I don’t think they’ll be able to avoid completely, but to at least address the need for these types of animal skins and other types of leather, they are working on certain alternatives.

[01:27:56] Shree Viswanathan: In fact, Patrick Thomas, the CEO who defended the company against Bernard, He’s now on the board of a company in California, which focuses on mycelium. So bringing it back to your question, I think that sort of a reputational risk is what I worry about the most. I’ll keep my fingers crossed as to when the next existential question arises.

[01:28:20] Clay Finck: Yeah, that makes sense. It’s pretty easy to tell you’re very knowledgeable about this business. So before I give you the final handoff, I’m not sure if there’s anything else that you’d like to cover just to give you the opportunity to share anything we might’ve missed during this discussion.

[01:28:36] Shree Viswanathan: No, your questions were very well thought out, detailed, given that the company has such a long history, we could pick any one of those topics and go into just one question or maybe a couple of questions and make that a podcast by itself.

[01:28:51] Shree Viswanathan: But thank you for giving me the opportunity to talk about a very high quality business. Whether I own it or not, you know, the business is, business talks quality and highlights its own strengths and establishes its presence in a very dynamic industry. So thanks for giving me the opportunity to talk about a wonderful business today.
